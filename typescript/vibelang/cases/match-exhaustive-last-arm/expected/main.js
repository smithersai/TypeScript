// A match without default that D209 proves exhaustive runs its last arm
// without testing it (D294), or with a check that adds no branch when an arm
// tests a class: no final if and no $noMatch, after return, inside an
// expression, as a statement, and in an Effect function, and the last arm
// still binds its names (arms.vibe, expected/arms.js). Over a type
// that is not a finite union, a match without default keeps its tests and
// $noMatch, which throws the proposal's TypeError (D209), as text does here.
