# vibelang

> **Warning:** VibeLang is v0. The language will change in major, breaking ways. It is not suitable for production use.

The VibeLang compiler and language server. VibeLang is a readable syntax for
Effect that compiles to JavaScript with TypeScript declarations: `vibelang` checks `.vibe` and `.ts` files
together and emits JavaScript that runs on Effect 4. Enable `declaration`
to emit `.d.ts` files. Documentation:
[vibelang.sh](https://vibelang.sh).

## Start a project

```sh
bun create vibelang@latest my-app
# or
npm create vibelang@latest my-app
```

## Add VibeLang to an existing project

```sh
npm install --save-exact effect@4.0.6 vibelang-runtime
npm install --save-dev vibelang
```

Install exactly `effect@4.0.6`. The version is exact because the runtime reads
fiber internals and rejects other versions at load. Keep `@effect/platform-node`
and `@effect/vitest` at that same version when you use them. Existing projects
also need the `@effect/platform-node-shared` override. Follow
[the complete installation steps](https://vibelang.sh/setup/existing-project)
before adding those packages.

Generated JavaScript imports `effect` and `vibelang-runtime`, so both are runtime
dependencies. Point `tsconfig.json` at your `.vibe` sources:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "NodeNext",
    "moduleResolution": "NodeNext",
    "strict": true,
    "rootDir": "src",
    "outDir": "dist",
    "rewriteRelativeImportExtensions": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*.vibe"]
}
```

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npx vibelang` | Check and compile the project in `tsconfig.json`, like `tsc` |
| `npx vibelang --watch` | Recompile on every save |
| `npx vibelang --lsp --stdio` | Run the language server for an editor |
| `npx vibelang --version` | Print the VibeLang and TypeScript versions |

For tests with Vitest, add [`vibelang-vite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vibelang-vite).

## Run .vibe modules in Node

```sh
node --import vibelang/register src/main.ts
```

`vibelang/register` lets Node import `.vibe` modules from source, so a
TypeScript entry point, a script, or a test that spawns `node` needs no `dist/`.
The first `.vibe` import compiles the whole project in the nearest
`tsconfig.json` above the module, once per process; every `.vibe` module of that
project comes from that compile. Set `VIBELANG_PROJECT` to a tsconfig path to
choose another project, such as `tsconfig.test.json` for an example beside a
library; it compiles the modules in its directory, and a module of another
workspace package, such as a dependency linked to its source, still compiles
with that package's own `tsconfig.json`. A module keeps its source URL, so a `.ts` file imported
by both a TypeScript and a `.vibe` module loads once. Diagnostics that stop the
compile are thrown at the import. The hook turns on Node's source-map support,
so a stack trace names `.vibe` lines. It needs Node 26 or later, for
`module.registerHooks`. `VIBELANG_REGISTER_DEBUG=1` prints each project's
compile time, or that it came from the cache.

A long-running process compiles a project again when it imports a `.vibe`
module that changed after the project compiled, or that did not exist yet, so
a watcher that re-imports an edited file under a new URL gets its new code. The
errors carry a `code`, as Node's module errors do: `ERR_VIBELANG_COMPILE` when
the project does not compile (the message holds the diagnostics), and
`ERR_VIBELANG_PROJECT` when the module is outside the project.

### The compile cache

A project's compile is cached on disk, so the next process that imports the same
project reuses it instead of compiling again. Cache lookup takes milliseconds;
it does not include loading Effect or the rest of process startup. One Linux x64
review run measured about 0.5 s for a warm Node start, including loading Effect,
with 38 ms spent reading the cache, versus 1.3 s with the cache disabled. These
are single-machine observations. `vibelang/register`,
`vibelang/bun`, `vibelang-vite`, and `vibelang-unplugin` share the cache. A
cached compile is reused only while all of these are unchanged:

| Input | What counts as a change |
| --- | --- |
| Sources | A file the compile read, by content; a dependency's file by size, modification time, and inode |
| Project files | A file added to or removed from a directory the tsconfig's `include` scans |
| Configuration | The tsconfig, every config it `extends`, and the configs its `references` name; for another workspace package's `.vibe` source in the program, that package's `tsconfig.json`, whose settings it is checked with |
| Packages | The `package.json` nearest each source, and the lockfiles and package-manager state (`node_modules/.modules.yaml`, `.package-lock.json`, and so on) in the project's directory and above |
| Compiler | The compiler file, and the native binary the `vibelang` launcher runs |

A failed compile is never cached, and neither is one whose sources changed
while it ran. Entries are written to a temporary file and renamed into place,
so any number of processes can share a cache directory.

| Setting | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `VIBELANG_CACHE_DIR=<dir>` | Keep the cache in `<dir>` |
| `VIBELANG_DISABLE_CACHE=1` | Compile in every process; read and write no cache |
| Default | `vibelang-cache-<uid>` in the system's temporary directory, readable only by you |

The cache keeps one entry per project. It does not see a file that changes
module resolution from outside the project's `include` and outside
`node_modules`, or a `node_modules` link changed by hand rather than by a
package manager; edit the importing file, or delete the cache directory.

## Run .vibe modules in Bun

```sh
bun --preload vibelang/bun src/main.ts
```

`vibelang/bun` is the same loader for Bun, through a runtime plugin: `bun run`,
`bun test`, and a `preload` in `bunfig.toml` (top level for `bun run`, under
`[test]` for `bun test`). It compiles each project once per process, or loads it
from the compile cache, honors `VIBELANG_PROJECT`, and throws a failed compile's
diagnostics at the import. Bun 1.4.2 ignores a plugin's source maps, so a stack
frame names the `.vibe` file with the line of its compiled JavaScript. `bun
test` discovers only its own test file names, so a Bun suite is a `.test.ts`
file that imports `.vibe` modules.

## Compile projects from a tool

`vibelang/project` is the whole-project compile that `vibelang-vite`,
`vibelang-unplugin`, `vibelang/register`, and `vibelang/bun` share. `projects({
root, project, compiler })` serves each `.vibe` module from one compile per
tsconfig: a module inside `root` belongs to `project`; one of another workspace
package, such as a package another package imports, belongs to the nearest
`tsconfig.json` above it. Another package is one outside `root`, or one nested
inside it with its own `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`. `load(file)` returns
the module's JavaScript, its source map, and its project's diagnostics;
`invalidate()` makes every project compile again on its next load, or load from
the cache when nothing changed. `compileProjectSync`, `projectBackend`, and
`projects` take `cache: false` to turn the cache off, or `cache: { directory }`
to move it.

`projectImports({ project })` lists a project's module graph without
type-checking it: `files` is every file of the program, and `imports` is every
import its `.ts` and `.vibe` files write, as `{ importer, specifier, file }`
with the file the compiler resolved the specifier to, `.vibe` files included.
Type-only imports are listed too; a tool that needs only run-time edges reads
the importer's syntax. `errors` holds the diagnostics that stopped the compiler
from reading the project, such as an unknown compiler option. A dependency
checker or a circular-import guard reads this graph instead of resolving
`.vibe` specifiers itself.

```js
import { formatDiagnostic, projectImports } from "vibelang/project"

const { imports, errors } = projectImports({ project: "packages/app/tsconfig.json" })
if (errors.length) throw new Error(errors.map(formatDiagnostic).join("\n"))
for (const { importer, specifier, file } of imports) console.log(importer, specifier, file)
```

## Editor support

This package ships the VS Code extension. In a project with `vibelang` installed:

```sh
code --install-extension node_modules/vibelang/editor/vibelang.vsix
cursor --install-extension node_modules/vibelang/editor/vibelang.vsix
```

The extension starts the project's own `vibelang` as the language server.

## Agent skill

The package ships an agent skill for writing VibeLang, `node_modules/vibelang/skills/vibelang/SKILL.md`: every form, rule and idiom of this version, with [measured token counts](https://vibelang.sh/vibelang-features/117-token-counts). Point an agent's instructions at it (D292).

## Format .vibe files with dprint

The package ships a [dprint](https://dprint.dev) plugin for `.vibe` files. Use
dprint 0.64.3 or later for `npm:` plugin resolution. Add
it beside dprint's TypeScript plugin, and add `vibe` to `includes`:

```json
{
  "includes": ["**/*.{ts,vibe}"],
  "plugins": [
    "https://plugins.dprint.dev/typescript-0.93.4.wasm@cdbf74066391bdb11ddaef9ea95299636a97d637f5a9bf7f121d584875647c7a",
    "npm:vibelang/dprint-plugin.json"
  ]
}
```

`dprint fmt` and `dprint check` then format `.vibe` files with the
configuration's `typescript` settings, so they read like the project's `.ts`
files. See [Format with dprint](https://vibelang.sh/setup/formatting).

## Lint .vibe files with ESLint

`vibelang/eslint` is an ESLint parser for `.vibe` files: it gives ESLint the
tree typescript-eslint gives for TypeScript, so the same rules and plugins
apply. Install `eslint` and `typescript-eslint` 8 beside `vibelang`:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import tseslint from "typescript-eslint"
import vibelang from "vibelang/eslint"

export default tseslint.config({
  files: ["src/**/*.vibe"],
  extends: [tseslint.configs.recommended],
  languageOptions: { parser: vibelang }
})
```

Rules that need type information don't run on `.vibe` files;
`vibelang --noEmit` checks types. The
[Devtools page](https://vibelang.sh/getting-started/012-devtools) lists the node types of VibeLang's own forms.

## How the package finds the native compiler

`vibelang` is a small Node launcher. In 0.0.10, the native compiler comes from one of four
optional dependencies, and npm installs the one that matches your platform:
`vibelang-darwin-arm64`, `vibelang-darwin-x64`, `vibelang-linux-arm64`,
`vibelang-linux-x64`. Native Windows binaries are not published yet; use WSL. The launcher
runs `VIBELANG_BINARY` when set, then `native/vibelang` beside the package in a
VibeLang checkout, then the platform package. If you installed with optional
dependencies omitted, reinstall without that option. The launcher forwards
arguments, standard streams, signals, and the exit status.

## License

Apache-2.0. The compiler is a modified version of the TypeScript 7 compiler
(typescript-go); see `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`.

## Develop the compiler

From the VibeLang repository root:

```sh
sh scripts/build-vibelang.sh      # writes packages/compiler/native/vibelang and dprint-plugin.json
packages/compiler/bin/vibelang --version
node --test packages/compiler/test/*.test.mjs
```

A checkout's launcher prefers `native/vibelang`, so projects that link to the
checkout use a rebuilt compiler without reinstalling.

### Bun runtime watch limitation

With Bun 1.4.1, `bun --watch --preload vibelang/bun` does not reliably restart after a `.vibe` save. The preload compiles once per process and does not invalidate that result during watch. For development, use the starter's `npm run dev` or `bun run dev`: its compiler watch and Node process rebuild and restart the app.
