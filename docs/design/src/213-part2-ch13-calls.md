## Part II. The rules

Part I showed the language by example. This part states its rules precisely, still from the programmer's side; Part III explains how the runtime carries them out.

### 13. What a call means

#### One syntax, several meanings

A call is always written `f(x)`; what it compiles to depends on what `f` is, decided from the types:

```ts es
const n = double(4)                    // VibeLang function that compiles to plain JavaScript
const user = Users.find(id)            // service method
const row = findUser(id)               // TypeScript function returning an Effect
const label = formatName(user)         // trusted TypeScript function
const ok = Approval.approve(request)   // control operation
const port = Port()                    // a Config value: data until called
```

```ts gen
const n = double$direct(4)                     // a plain JavaScript call (Chapter 15)
const user = yield* (yield* Users).find(id)    // the implementation in the current Context, then the method
const row = yield* findUser(id)                // runs the returned program
const label = formatName(user)                 // an ordinary call
const ok = yield* (yield* Approval).approve(request)    // asks the nearest handler (Chapter 9)
const port = yield* Port                       // runs the Config
```

The full rule:

| The callee is | The call | Generated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A VibeLang function that can pause | Runs it on the current fiber | `yield* f(a)` |
| A VibeLang function that compiles to plain JavaScript (Chapter 15) | Runs it inline | `f$direct(a)`, or `f(a)` with a plain return annotation (D67) |
| A TypeScript function whose call has type `Effect<A, E, R>` | Runs the returned program | `yield* f(a)` |
| A TypeScript function whose R contains a control operation | Rejected in v0: EK4202 (Chapter 9) | |
| A value of an `Effect` type, called as `p()` | Runs it | `yield* p` |
| A service member, `Users.find(id)` or `Path.join(a, b)` | Looks up the service in the current Context (joining R), then applies these rules to the member: an `Effect` runs, a plain value is a trusted call (Chapter 4) | `yield* (yield* Users).find(id)`; `(yield* Path).join(a, b)` |
| A service member that is an `Effect` value, `Terminal.readLine()` | Looks the service up, then runs the member | `yield* (yield* Terminal).readLine` |
| A pipe's topic, `%` in `fetchUser(id) \|> retry(%, policy)` | Where `%` stands for a program, the pipe's left side, passed by name (D155); elsewhere the left side's value, computed once before the body | `retry(Effect.gen(function* () { return yield* fetchUser(id) }), policy)` |
| A method of an Effect data type, `stream.take(3)` or `fiber.join()` | Calls the module's function with the value first (D152), then applies these rules to that call: an `Effect` runs, other data is returned | `Stream.take(stream, 3)`; `yield* Fiber.join(fiber)` |
| A service, `Users()` | Returns the implementation | `yield* Users` |
| A control operation, `Approval.approve(x)` | Asks the nearest handler on this fiber | `yield* (yield* Approval).approve(x)` |
| A JavaScript built-in, or an export of `effect` or `@effect/*` that does not return an `Effect` | A trusted call: listed exceptions join E, others are defects | `f(a)`, with listed exceptions converted |
| A TypeScript function wrapped with `trusted(impl, [Errors])` (D249, Chapter 10) | Runs the returned `Effect` | `yield* f(a)` |
| Any other plain TypeScript or JavaScript function | Rejected: EK4401 (Chapter 10) | |
| A platform API, or a clock or randomness read | Rejected: EK4402, EK4403 (Chapters 10, 11) | |
| `new C(…)` | Constructs; never runs a program | `new C(…)` |

Because the meaning depends on types, the compiler needs TypeScript's type checker, not a source transform, so VibeLang is a fork of the TypeScript compiler (Chapter 27).

#### Calls run `Effect` itself, not everything that extends it

A call runs its result only when the call's instantiated type is `Effect<A, E, R>` itself. Several Effect types extend `Effect` with structure of their own: `Config` (`Config.ts:113`), `Exit` (`Exit.ts:89`), service keys (`Context.ts:68`), and `TaggedError` instances, which are yieldable (`Cause.ts:1312`). A call returning one of them returns data; calling that data runs it:

```ts es
const Port = Config.withDefault(Config.Port("PORT"), 3000)    // data: composed before anything reads it

function makeError(raw: string) {
  return new InvalidId({ raw })                                // data: returned, not thrown
}

function serverPort() {
  return Port()                                                // runs the Config
}
```

Without this rule, `Config.Port("PORT")` would read the variable before `Config.withDefault` saw it, and `makeError` would fail instead of returning an error value.

#### Methods on Effect's data types

`x.name(args)` is a method call into a module (D152) when all of these hold:

1. The access is in a `.vibe` file and not in an optional chain (`x?.name(…)`).
2. `x`'s type, after TypeScript resolves type parameters to their constraints, has no member `name` of its own.
3. One of Effect's data-type modules declares `x`'s type in `effect/dist/<Module>.d.ts`. For a union, every member comes from the same module, as `None` and `Some` come from `Option`.
4. That module exports a function `name` with an overload whose first parameter is named `self`, Effect's name for a dual's data-first form, or ends in `OrOptions`, or has the name D295's table gives that function, such as `input` for `Cause.findErrorOption` and `n` for `BigDecimal.abs`.

The method's signatures are those overloads with the first parameter moved to `this`; a curried overload, such as `Stream.zipLeft(right)`, takes another first parameter and is not one of them. TypeScript checks `x` against it, infers type parameters from it, and narrows `x` by a type predicate on it:

```ts es
function describe(value: Option.Option<number>) {
  if (value.isSome()) return `some ${value.value}`   // Option.isSome(value): value is Some<number>
  return "none"
}
```

The call compiles to `Module.name(x, args)`, and the rules above apply to that: `Fiber.join(fiber)` returns an `Effect`, so `fiber.join()` runs; `Stream.take` returns a `Stream`, which is data. The method exists only in a call: `const read = maybe.getOrElse` is EK4501 (D153), because no function value exists to bind; pass `Option.getOrElse` itself.

#### Function values

A function used as a value is passed in the form its destination expects:

| Expected type | What is passed |
| --- | --- |
| A function type that returns an `Effect`, as Effect's combinators expect | The function's Effect form |
| A plain function type, as `Array.prototype.map` expects | The function's plain-JavaScript form, if it has one (Chapter 15); otherwise EK4301 |
| `Effect<A, E, R>`, an iterable or record of them | A function with no parameters, converted to a program (Chapter 5); or an expression that calls an Effect, passed by name (D147) |
| Either a function or an `Effect`, as `HttpRouter.add` and `Effect.withErrorReporting` accept | With parameters: the function. Without: the function if it compiles to plain JavaScript, a program if it can pause |

The last row matters because several Effect APIs choose at run time with `Effect.isEffect`. In `HttpRouter.add("GET", "/users/:id", (request) => showUser(request))`, the handler has a parameter, so it is passed as a function. In `HttpRouter.add("GET", "/health", () => checkHealth())` and `Effect.withErrorReporting(() => serve())`, the argument can pause, so it is passed as a program.

An Effect callback or program destination means Effect's own interface, or a type parameter constrained to it; structured subtypes such as `Config` remain data (D109). A destination that allows both plain and Effect returns selects plain when D10 permits and Effect otherwise (D112). A contract-annotated lambda selected as plain has type `(…) => A`, and plain-callback inference starts from A (D113). These rules apply to named function values as well as lambdas (D66).

#### Programs and continuations

This document has two kinds of "rest of the work", and they behave differently: a **program** is the reusable kind from Chapter 5; a **continuation** is the `k` a handler receives in Chapter 9.

| | Program | Continuation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What it is | A description of work that has not started | The rest of one particular run, paused at a call |
| Created by | Writing a function or thunk; importing an `Effect` | A control operation, when a handler receives it |
| How many times it runs | Every time it is called | At most once |
| Retry | Runs it again from scratch, with fresh local variables | Impossible: it has been used |
| Other fibers | Can run on any fiber (`fork`) | Only on the fiber that created it |
| Type | `() => A` with contract `Effect<A, E, R>`; `Effect<A, E, R>` at the TypeScript boundary | `Continuation<V, E, H>`, usable only inside its clause (Chapter 9) |

#### How program values are spelled

A call runs where it stands, except where the expected type is `Effect`: there an expression that calls a `.vibe` or `Effect`-returning function, or looks up a service, is passed by name (D147), as a program that evaluates the expression on each run, as if `() =>` preceded it. So `Effect.retry(syncInventory(store), Schedule.recurs(3))` retries the call, and `fork(fetchReport())` runs nothing at the call site. This holds for arguments, array elements and record fields, in function bodies and at a module's top level. A position that accepts any value, such as `Console.log`'s or `Effect.succeed`'s parameters, still runs the call where it stands, and an expression whose value is already an `Effect` keeps its meaning. A contextually Effect-typed object-literal field also holds the program (D265), including a service implementation in `Layer.sync`, a record parameter, and a declared object type: building `{ read: work() }` runs none of `work` when `read` expects an Effect, while a non-Effect field runs the call and stores its result. Each overload candidate decides by its own declared parameter, as for a lambda (D56). A hover on the callee of a call passed by name says so.

A `const` whose declared type is Effect holds its initializer in every scope (D269, extending D262 and D265). `const built: Made = make(config)` calls `make` here and runs none of the returned program; running `built` later runs that same program each time. Only the initializer is held; calls in its operands keep their ordinary positions. Mutable bindings and inferred or asserted types do not opt in.

A function whose declared return type is Effect may explicitly return a program (D269). The declaration may be its own annotation, its binding's, or a lambda's declared member or parameter type under D44. A return is a program when it is a parameterless function literal, converted by D7, or a non-call expression of Effect type, and TypeScript would reject it as the success type A. Such a function is a **factory**: its body runs when called, as plain JavaScript, which never fails (D282), and running its result runs the program, every time. Every return path returns a program (EK2116). The body runs no Effect and looks up no service (EK2115); put that work in the returned program. An eager `throw` is EK2115 too: return `() => { throw e }` so the program fails when it runs. A factory has no plain variant, so it is EK4301 where a plain function is expected.

```ts es
const capture = (input: { mutable value: number }): Effect.Effect<number, never, never> => {
  const snapshot = input.value                  // at the call
  return () => snapshot                         // each run returns this snapshot
}
```

VibeLang calls keep D24 and D147: `capture(input)` runs the result, `retry(capture(input), policy)` repeats the call on every attempt, and `const p: Effect.Effect<number> = capture(input)` holds one call's program. Retrying `p` repeats only the program, with one snapshot. The factory forms were TS2322 before D269. Already-valid values keep their meaning: `Effect.suspend(() => () => 1)` infers a function as A and still returns that function as data.

A program of several statements needs a form that does not run: a function with no parameters. The compiler converts such a function to an `Effect` only where the expected type is `Effect`, including array elements and record fields, such as `Effect.all`'s argument, and an array or record of programs built at run time, such as `stores.map(makeSync)` (D49). Other iterables, including `Set` and `Map` values, convert by their iterated type, never as records (D111). It never converts a value merely because it looks like a function:

```ts gen
// Effect.retry(syncInventory(store), Schedule.recurs(3))
yield* Effect.retry(Effect.gen(function* () { return yield* syncInventory(store); }), Schedule.recurs(3))
// Effect.retry(retrySync, Schedule.recurs(3)), with const retrySync = () => syncInventory(store)
yield* Effect.retry(Effect.suspend(retrySync), Schedule.recurs(3))
```

"The expected type" means exactly the declared parameter type of the overload candidate TypeScript is trying, before instantiation (D44). TypeScript's own contextual type is wrong here, because it is inferred from the argument itself. In `ids.map((id) => Users.find(id))`, `map`'s declared parameter is `(value: T, index: number) => U`, a plain function type, so the lambda is a callback that cannot pause (EK4301); instantiating `U` from the lambda would make it look like an Effect position. When resolution fails, the candidates whose arity fits decide. The instantiated type is used only when the declared type is a bare type parameter fixed by another argument, such as `Layer.succeed`'s `NoInfer<S>`.

TypeScript tries overload candidates in declaration order. Against each, the lambda takes the form the candidate's parameter declares: a plain function, an Effect function, or a program (D56). Among applicable candidates, one whose parameter expects an `Effect` and passes a program argument by name outranks one that would run that same argument (D257). A running call whose result type is `never` makes no parameter applicable during ranking. It fails, rather than supplying a value accepted by every parameter. Otherwise, the first applicable candidate wins. Thus `Effect.race(Effect.fail(a), Effect.fail(b))` selects the two-program form. Case `overload-program-ranking` pins this rule.

```ts dts
// helpers.d.ts: a plain callback first, an Effect callback second
import { Effect } from "effect"

// The package is listed in vibelang.trustedPackages (Chapter 10).
export declare function register(f: (x: number) => number): string
export declare function register<E, R>(f: (x: number) => Effect.Effect<number, E, R>): Effect.Effect<string, E, R>
```

```ts es
const a = register((x) => Math.max(x, 0))                    // plain: overload 1 accepts it
const b = register((x) => Users.find(String(x)).id.length)   // Effect function: overload 2
```

Against overload 1, `b`'s lambda is a plain function, which cannot call a service, so overload 1 fails and overload 2 accepts the Effect form. Swap the overloads and `a`'s lambda becomes an Effect function: declaration order decides, as in TypeScript. The lambda's own inferred type never picks its form, so the result does not depend on which form the compiler tries first. A lambda with no expected type, such as one a function returns, is plain when Chapter 15's rule allows and an Effect function otherwise.

#### Where programs start

A call never starts a fiber; a program starts only when a **runner** receives it. The compiler recognizes runners by their resolved symbols: `Effect.runPromise`, `runPromiseExit`, `runSync`, `runSyncExit`, `runFork`, `runCallback`, and their `*With` forms; `ManagedRuntime`'s `run*` methods; `NodeRuntime.runMain` and `BunRuntime.runMain`; and `@effect/vitest`'s `it.effect`, `it.live`, their `.each` and `.prop` forms, and `layer(…)`.

```ts es
// main.vibe
export function main() {
  const name = Effect.provide(() => welcome("42"), AppLive)
  log(`welcomed ${name}`)
}

NodeRuntime.runMain(() => main())
```

A TypeScript entry file works too, because `main()` returns an ordinary cold `Effect`:

```ts ts
// run.ts
import { NodeRuntime } from "@effect/platform-node"
import { main } from "./main.js"

NodeRuntime.runMain(main())
```

A module that exports a function declaration named `main` with no parameters gets an entry statement unless it already calls a runner at its top level (D135). For this suppression check, a call named `runMain`, `runPromise`, `runFork`, `runSync`, or `runCallback` counts. The entry statement uses `runtime.$entry` to start `main` only when the host starts this module. Importing it starts nothing. The helper checks the started file's exported `main` in bundles and CommonJS output, so an imported module's `main` does not start with the entry module's.

The compiler uses `NodeRuntime.runMain` when `@effect/platform-node` resolves from the module, and the runtime's `$runMain` otherwise. A `main` that compiles to plain JavaScript runs through `Effect.sync`. A platform import, `import "vibelang/platform/node"`, `"vibelang/platform/bun"`, or `"vibelang/platform/browser"`, selects the platform layers the entry supplies (D312, Chapter 11). An explicit top-level runner supplies its own layers and options and suppresses the generated entry.

A module's top level is inside no program. A call there may build values, such as `Layer.effect(…)`, `wire(…)`, `Config.Port(…)`, or `Schedule.exponential(…)`, but not run a program:

```ts es
// config.vibe
export const config = loadConfig()
```

```text
error EK1001: loadConfig() runs a program, but a module's top level is not inside one.
  config.vibe:2:23   export const config = loadConfig()
  Export a function instead, or provide the value as a service with a Layer.
```

A runner is called only where no fiber runs the code: a module's top level, or a plain callback that such a place passes to a TypeScript function, such as a `describe` body or a web framework's route handler. In code a fiber runs, a runner would start a new root with an empty Context and no handlers, outside the caller's structured concurrency:

```ts es
function refreshAll(ids: ReadonlyArray<string>) {
  for (const id of ids) Effect.runFork(refresh(id))
}
```

```text
error EK1005: Effect.runFork starts a new root fiber, but refreshAll already runs on one.
  refresh.vibe:2:25   for (const id of ids) Effect.runFork(() => refresh(id))
  Call the program, or fork it so the block owns it:   fork(() => refresh(id))
```

Tests in `.vibe` use `it.effect`. A test that must `await` a Promise stays in a `.ts` file.

#### Evaluation order

Generated code keeps JavaScript's evaluation order. Arguments are evaluated left to right, each once. A receiver is evaluated once and keeps its `this`. `a() && b()` runs `b` only if `a()` is truthy. A getter runs once per access. In `double(w) * double(h) * Settings.scale()`, both `double` calls run before the service call, though only the service call can pause (Chapter 15).

#### Blocks as values

A `do { }` expression (D187, the TC39 [do expressions](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-do-expressions) proposal) has the value of its last statement. It runs where it stands; a parameter that expects a program takes it by name, like a call (D147):

```ts
function cached(): string!! {
  sleep("1 millis")
  return "cached"
}

function fetched(): string!! {
  sleep("1 second")
  return "fetched"
}

function first() {
  return race(do { const value = cached(); value.toUpperCase() }, fetched())
}
```

#### Blocks after calls

A block on the same line after a call or a name is the call's program (D188, the TC39 [block params](https://github.com/samuelgoto/proposal-block-params) proposal). The block is the call's last argument, except when the callee is an Effect dual: there it takes the program's place, as in `withSpan(block, "guarded")` or `semaphore.withPermits(1)(block)`, and the call infers its type parameters from the arguments and the block together:

```ts
function work(): string!! {
  sleep("1 millis")
  return "done"
}

function guarded() {
  const semaphore = Semaphore.make(1)
  const result = semaphore.withPermits(1) {
    return work()
  }
  return withSpan("guarded") {
    return result.toUpperCase()
  }
}
```

The block is a function body, so a value needs `return`.
