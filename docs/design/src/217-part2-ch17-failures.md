### 17. Failures, defects, interruption, and cleanup

```ts es
function exportReport(id: string) {
  using tmp = TempFiles.create()
  try {
    writeRows(tmp, Reports.rows(id))
    return Storage.upload(tmp)
  } catch (e) {                    // e: UploadError
    return Storage.queueRetry(id)
  } finally {
    Metrics.increment("exports")
  }
}

function exportWithDeadline(id: string) {
  return timeout(exportReport(id), "30 seconds")
}
```

If the 30 seconds run out during the upload, the upload is interrupted, the `catch` block does not run, the `finally` block runs, the temporary file is removed, and the `Effect.timeout` call fails with `Cause.TimeoutError`. Each kind of exit has one rule:

| Exit | Source | In E | Runs `catch` | Runs `finally` and `using` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Expected failure | `throw` in VibeLang; a callee's E; an exception a trusted contract lists | Yes | Yes, narrowed by type | Yes |
| Defect | Any other JavaScript exception, such as `(undefined as any).x`; `Effect.die` | No | No; observe it with `Effect.catchDefect` at a boundary | Yes |
| Interruption | Another fiber, a timeout, or an enclosing scope closing | No | No | Yes |
| Abandonment | A handler that does not continue its program (Chapter 9) | No | No | Yes |
| Expected failures plus a defect | A `finally` that crashed while the block was failing | No: each expected failure becomes a defect of the same error, first, as in Effect 4.0.6 (D305) | No: the whole exit propagates with every reason, the failures as defects | Yes |
| Expected failures plus an interruption | A joined fiber that was interrupted while its `finally` threw | Yes | Yes; `e` is the first, and the interruption is dropped, as `Effect.catch` drops it (D306) | Yes |
| Several expected failures | `Effect.race` with both branches failed | Yes | Yes; `e` is the first, and the `catch` handles the exit as a whole | Yes |

Rules:

- **E comes from `throw` and from contracts.** A `throw` in an Effect function, a callee's E, and the exceptions a trusted contract lists are expected failures. Any other JavaScript exception is a defect, as in Effect today.
- **A defect beside an expected failure wins, as in Effect 4.0.6** (D305). Where a failure meets a cleanup's or a sibling's defect, each expected failure becomes a defect of the same error, first, in order (Effect-TS/effect#9433), whether Effect combines them or the kernel does when a handler abandons a continuation (K16a, K16b). No typed recovery runs on such a cause: not `catch`, not `Effect.catch`, `Effect.result` or `retry` (#9516). `Effect.catchDefect` and `exit` see it.
- **`catch` recovers as `Effect.catch` does** (D306). It handles the first expected failure of a cause with no defect and drops any interruption or further failure beside it. A cause with a defect passes through with its failures as defects (K16d), and one with no expected failure passes through untouched. One rule is VibeLang's own: a failure raised while a handler abandons a continuation (Chapter 9) passes every `catch` inside that continuation, so cleanup can't resume abandoned code (K14d). Source `catch` therefore compiles to the runtime's `catchExpected` (K14a-K14d, Chapter 26). A catch expression, `x catch fallback` or `x catch (e) => …` (D236), compiles to `catchExpected` too, so it recovers exactly what the statement recovers.
- **Cleanup runs in reverse order of acquisition**, once per exit, with interruption held off until it finishes.
- **VibeLang preserves failures from its own cleanup** (D15, D256). It adds them to the cause while unwinding a block, closing a scope, abandoning a continuation, or exiting a fiber, including while interruption is pending (K12a-K12e, K13d). An enclosing Effect operator can choose another exit. In particular, `timeout` and `race` can discard an interrupted loser's cleanup failure. The cleanup runs, but that failure need not reach the operator's caller. F11e in `experiments/tests/defect-precedence.test.ts` pins the timeout case.
- **Control cannot leave a `finally` block.** A `return`, `break`, or `continue` there would replace the block's exit, and in JavaScript it discards a failure in flight, so it is EK2006.
- **Abandonment unwinds like interruption.** Cleanup sees an interrupted exit, `catch` does not run, and the handler that abandoned the program continues only after cleanup finishes. A cleanup failure during abandonment fails the `handle` or the `abandon` call that abandoned.
- **Cleanup that uses a control operation handles it inside the cleanup** (Chapter 9). A handler outside could stop the cleanup partway.

#### Effect's operators on a mixed cause

Effect's own operators keep their Effect behavior when VibeLang calls them. A cause that Effect or the kernel builds from an expected failure and a defect holds only defects (D305), and the typed operators treat a hand-built one the same way:

| Operators | Given an expected failure plus a defect |
| --- | --- |
| `Effect.catch`, `catchTag`, `catchIf`, `result`, `option`, `match`, `ignore`, `orElseSucceed`, `firstSuccessOf`, `flip`, `validate`, `partition`, `retry` | Run no handler; the cause propagates with every failure as a defect |
| `Effect.mapError` | Maps every expected failure in place and keeps the other reasons |
| `Effect.catchDefect` | Acts on the first defect, the original error once it is a defect, and drops the rest |
| `Effect.exit`, `Effect.catchCause`, `Effect.sandbox` | Keep every reason |

Given an expected failure plus an interruption and no defect, the typed operators act on the first failure and drop the interruption, `retry` retries, and `mapError` keeps the interruption. These were checked against `effect@4.0.6` (F11a-F11e). Use such an operator where dropping a reason is what the program means; a VibeLang `catch` drops only what `Effect.catch` drops.

Effect's own combinators hold off interruption for a block of work:

```ts es
function moveFunds(from: Account, to: Account, amount: number) {
  Effect.uninterruptible {
    Ledger.debit(from, amount)
    Ledger.credit(to, amount)     // an interruption waits until both have run
  }
}
```

In any function that compiles to frames, `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and `using` compile to Effect's own failure and cleanup frames, never to JavaScript `try`: Effect does not run JavaScript `finally` blocks inside generators when a fiber fails or is interrupted (F1-F3), so a JavaScript `try` would skip cleanup. Chapter 26 shows the generated code. Functions that compile to plain JavaScript are the exception, because nothing in them can pause (Chapter 15).

#### Causes, exits, and interruption blocks

```ts es
error Unavailable

function fetchSnapshot(): string!Unavailable {
  sleep("1 millis")
  return "snapshot"
}

function snapshotOrFallback() {
  try {
    const outcome = exit(fetchSnapshot())
    if (outcome is Exit.Success(let snapshot)) return snapshot
    const cause = outcome.cause
    if (cause.hasInterrupts()) throw cause
    return cause.hasFails() ? "cached" : "degraded"
  } finally (exit) {
    logDebug(`snapshot ${exit._tag}`)
  }
}

function commit(rows: ReadonlyArray<string>) {
  uninterruptible {
    logInfo(`writing ${rows.length} rows`)
    restore {
      sleep("10 millis")
    }
    logInfo("written")
  }
}
```

- `exit(program)` holds every reason a failure holds, defects and interrupts included, as `Effect.exit` does; test it with `is` or `match` on `Exit.Success` and `Exit.Failure` to recover from the whole cause (D217). The earlier form, a catch clause typed `Cause` (D176), still compiles, as `Effect.catchCause` with a control operation's abandonment passed through untouched, but is retired: it draws warning EK2113, whose quick fix writes the `match`.
- `throw` with a `Cause` fails with every reason it holds, as `Effect.failCause` does, and adds the Cause's E to the function's E (D177).
- `finally (exit)` binds the statement's `Exit<void, E>`, where E is what the try statement can fail with. The block runs uninterruptibly, as `Effect.onExit`'s finalizer does, and a success carries no value (D178).
- `exit(program)`, `interrupt()`, and `yieldNow()` are bare functions (D179).
- An `uninterruptible` block runs as `Effect.uninterruptibleMask`, a `restore` block inside it as the mask's `restore`, and an `interruptible` block as `Effect.interruptible`. Their statements stay code of the enclosing function, and each block calls the prelude function of its name, which also takes a program directly (D180). A `restore` block outside an `uninterruptible` block is EK2111.
