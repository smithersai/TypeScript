### A. Evidence index

Run everything:

```sh
cd experiments
bun install        # effect@4.0.6 exactly
bun test           # {{testCount}} tests in {{testFiles}} files, about a second
bun test ./tests/runtime-boundaries.test.ts         # runtime boundary regressions
bun test ./tests/acquisition-cancellation.test.ts ./tests/generator-tail-resume.test.ts
bun bench/perform.ts
bun bench/deep-capture.ts
node scripts/wakeup-chain-depth.ts       # F10 depths on this host (also runs under bun)
node scripts/v3-wakeup-chain.mjs 100000  # F10b: the same chain on effect 3.22.3
cd reference-machine && bun install && bun test   # strategy B, 20 tests, about 18 s
```

The docs site build (`site/scripts/build-docs.ts`) runs this suite first and won't build if a test fails.

#### How this revision was checked

The conformance suite exercises the kernel's ownership, interruption, tracing, and cleanup laws. Boundary regressions pin mixed causes, acquisition masking, transferred continuations, and generator tail resumes. The fixes and their regression tests are described in `experiments/KERNEL-CHANGES.md`.

A feature-coverage audit mapped 309 Effect features to the language (`docs/research/effect-feature-coverage.md`); D22-D28 and D37-D43 resolve its gaps. A prototype compiler compiled 46 examples from the specification (D44-D53). A single-pass experiment reached the same lowering, byte for byte, with one TypeScript check per file (D56 and D52).

#### Effect facts

| ID | File | What it shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F1-F3 | `tests/effect-facts.test.ts` | JavaScript `finally` and `catch` in `Effect.gen` don't run when a yielded effect fails or the fiber is interrupted |
| F4 | same | A JavaScript exception in a generator body is a defect |
| F5, F6 | same | `Effect.callback` ignores every resume after the first; an asynchronous resume runs the fiber on the resumer's stack |
| F7, F8 | same | A child snapshots Context at fork, and nothing flows back; `forkChild` children are interrupted when the parent completes |
| F9 | same | Direct recursion limit: about 39,900 frames on Bun 1.4.1 and 10,150 on Node 26.10 |
| F10a, F10b | `tests/wakeup-chain.test.ts`, `scripts/` | A chain of `Deferred` wake-ups overflows in one fiber and strands the rest; effect 3.22.3 completes the same chain at 100,000 hops |
| F11a-F11e | `tests/defect-precedence.test.ts` | Effect 4.0.6 makes a failure beside a cleanup's or a sibling's defect a defect, first; typed recovery skips a cause with a defect; an interruption doesn't block recovery; `mapError` maps every failure; `timeout` still drops a loser's cleanup failure (D305, D256) |
| T5a, T6b | `tests/kernel.test.ts` | `Effect.callback` drops a late resume silently; plain JavaScript recursion overflows |
| D01-D05 | `tests/conformance/source-claims.test.ts` | Corrections to the first draft's Effect claims: synchronous callback resume, fork-time async context, `zip`'s `concurrent` flag, `catchCause` on a self-raised interrupt, sibling provides sharing a supplied `MemoMap` |
| A3 | `tests/fiber-behavior.test.ts` | Two providers for one key in `Layer.merge`: the later one wins silently |
| K15a | `tests/kernel-regressions.test.ts` | Default `acquireRelease` masks a wait: interruption waits for the value, which is then released |

#### Kernel laws

| ID | File | What it shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T1 | `tests/trace.test.ts` | Nested suspension and resumption keep Context and Scope; the clause sees the outer Context; the fiber waits at its root while the continuation is held |
| T2-T4 | `tests/kernel.test.ts` | Double resume is a defect; a clause that returns without resuming abandons first; interruption order is clause, continuation, outer |
| T5b, T5c, K10a, K10b | `tests/kernel.test.ts`, `tests/wakeup-chain.test.ts` | `suspend` reports lost races, delivers once, survives a 100,000-fiber chain, and releases a deferred value that loses to cancellation |
| T6a | `tests/kernel.test.ts` | 100,001 nested compiled frames captured in one operation and resumed |
| T7a, T7b, T8 | same | Capture through TypeScript-authored `Effect.forEach`; forking combinators and child fibers can't reach the parent's prompt |
| T9-T11 | same | Deep handlers; external iteration with `transfer`; retry runs fresh continuations |
| T12-T15 | `tests/kernel-edges.test.ts` | Pending interruption at resume; resume-site Context; fiber-affine abandonment (T14b caught a real bug); `HandlerPromptExited` instead of rebinding |
| T16, T17 | `tests/producers.test.ts` | `for...of` lowering: `break` runs the producer's finalizer first; 100,000 elements in constant stack with a `flatMap`-shaped clause |
| K11a-K11d | `tests/kernel-regressions.test.ts` | A generator clause that returns `tailResume` iterates 100,000 elements at 3 frames, 5 with a per-element `using` and `finally`; yielding a tail-resume request is a defect; a resume inside a `finally` region isn't a tail resume |
| K12a-K12e | same | Abandonment reports every cleanup failure beside real pending interruptions: explicit `abandon`, `abandonNow`, owner exit, and Scope exit |
| K13a-K13e | same | A transferred continuation never outlives its capturing fiber; transfer into a parallel Scope is rejected |
| K14a-K14d | same | `catchExpected` follows `Effect.catch`: it recovers the first expected failure of a cause with no defect and drops an interruption beside it (D306); a cause with a defect passes as defects; an abandonment passes through untouched |
| K15b, K15c | same | Interruptible acquisition: cancellation wins, and late or deferred values are released |
| K16a-K16d | same | Where the kernel combines or re-raises a cause (owner exit, fiber exit, `catchExpected`), a failure beside a defect is a defect; an expected cleanup failure stays expected (D305) |
| H1-H4 | `tests/handoff.test.ts` | Handoff: one delivery; late delivery during asynchronous shutdown released before cancellation completes; deferred delivery released; delivery after quiescence rejected |
| G6a, G6b | `tests/context-bridges.test.ts` | Spans are correct across capture; `AsyncLocalStorage` isn't delimited |
| Probes | `tests/fiber-behavior.test.ts` | 17 combinators keep control on the performing fiber; 7 move it to other fibers |
| A01-A04 | `tests/conformance/abandonment.test.ts` | Finalizer failures and swallowed aborts surface at every abandoning boundary |
| F01-F09 | `tests/conformance/frames.test.ts` | Effect's own frames (restore closures, masks, nested prompts, iterator frames, finalizers) behave correctly when spliced |
| I01-I11 | `tests/conformance/interruption.test.ts` | Interruption at capture, at resume, and during abandonment; real interrupts are never lost or mixed with the internal abort |
| O01-O08 | `tests/conformance/ownership.test.ts` | Nested owners, transfer, revocation, fiber affinity, and the ownership-cycle check |
| S01, S02 | `tests/conformance/scopes.test.ts` | `Effect.scoped`, `acquireRelease`, and Layer resources across resume and abandonment |
| T01, T02 | `tests/conformance/tracing-cache.test.ts` | `Effect.fn` and `withSpan` frames across capture; `Context.Reference` and fiber caches at every boundary |
| W01-W05 | `tests/conformance/wake.test.ts` | Wake budget ordering and release on every losing path |
| X01, X02 | `tests/conformance/async-frames.test.ts` | Effect's async finalizer frame inside a captured segment |
| B | `reference-machine/` | The independent strategy-B machine: 20 tests on the same laws |

The conformance suite (A, D, F, I, O, S, T, W, X) covers the kernel laws. Tests that encoded the old behavior as counterexamples now assert the corrected behavior.

#### Runtime boundary regressions

Runtime counterexamples are kept as observational tests. A probe of a fixed defect now asserts the fixed behavior.

| ID | File | What it showed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Boundary | `tests/runtime-boundaries.test.ts` | `Effect.catch` recovers a cause holding both a failure and a defect, and drops the defect (D13, K14); true of Effect 4.0.5, fixed in 4.0.6 (D305) |
| Boundary | same | Owner-driven abandonment keeps a cleanup defect; explicit `abandon` dropped it while an interruption was pending (D15, K12) |
| Boundary | same | Default `acquireRelease` shields `suspend` from cancellation (D25, K15) |
| Boundary | same | Inlining an `Effect.sync` operation removes an interruption point (D10) |
| Boundary | same | A child that transfers into its inherited Scope and exits stranded the segment (D16, K13) |
| Boundary | same | A TypeScript function forks its operation without taking a program argument (D20) |
| Boundary | same | A provider around `resumeWith` can't satisfy the injected program's R (D17) |
| Boundary | same | A block-wide Scope closes acquisitions not marked `using` (D14) |
| Boundary | same | Strategies A and B disagree on the next clause's Context after a resume (G16) |
| Boundary | same | A generator clause written `return yield* resume(k, v)` defeats constant-stack iteration (D18, K11) |
| Acquisition and tail resume | `tests/acquisition-cancellation.test.ts` | The masked adapter's race branches never run; generator clauses grow 200,003 frames over 100,000 elements before K11 |
| Services | `tests/service-identity/probe.ts` | Structurally equal abstract classes alias in R, and the program dies with `Service not found` (D1) |

#### Prototype compiler

The prototypes predate the rename to VibeLang, so their sources keep the old `.es` extension.

```sh
# From the repository root:
bun prototype/esc/examples/run-all.ts       # 46 of 46 example files pass, about 16 s
bun prototype/esc/src/cli.ts build prototype/esc/examples/ch01-first-look.es
bun prototype/esc/src/cli.ts run prototype/esc/examples/ch09-handlers.es
```

| What | Where | What it shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The compiler | `prototype/esc/src/` | Type-directed lowering of `.es` to TypeScript on `typescript@5.9.3`, with the experiments kernel as its runtime; about 3,560 lines |
| 26 runnable examples | `prototype/esc/examples/*.es` | Each compiles without errors and produces its stated result, including the six reference programs (`ref1` to `ref6`) |
| 20 expected failures | `prototype/esc/examples/*.fail.es` | Each reports its diagnostic code at the right span |
| `regions.es` | same | Completion records through nested `try`, `catch`, and `finally` match plain JavaScript's results and order |
| `stack-depth.es` | same | Producer loops and handler clauses stay under 50 frames over 100,000 elements |
| `scratch/probe2.ts` | `prototype/esc/scratch/` | The service emission of D45: nominal R, working `implements`, and a parameter typed with the service meaning its methods |
| Findings | `prototype/esc/FINDINGS.md` | Thirty findings, settled by D44-D53 |

#### Single-pass experiment

```sh
cd prototype/single-pass      # from the repository root
bun patch/apply.ts            # copy TypeScript 5.9.3 to typescript/ and patch it
bun harness/compare.ts        # the corpus: 46 of 46 files, about 10 s
bun harness/compare.ts --dir "$PWD/probes" --verbose
bun harness/passes.ts         # the prototype's decision changes per pass
```

| What | Where | What it shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The patched checker | `prototype/single-pass/patch/es-checker.js` | Each lambda classified per overload candidate inside `chooseOverload`, D10 on demand, and narrowing through the call rule: one 668-line block and 15 hooks in TypeScript 5.9.3 |
| The comparison | `prototype/single-pass/harness/compare.ts` | One check per file reaches the prototype's lowering in 46 of 46 files: 817 call sites, 257 lambdas and methods, 0 disagreements, byte-identical output, 46 checks instead of 124 |
| The probes | `prototype/single-pass/probes/` | 17 disagreements: 16 from 6 lambdas with two self-consistent lowerings (D56), 1 from mutual recursion (D52) |
| Results | `prototype/single-pass/RESULTS.md` | The method, the per-file table, and the rules for the Go checker (Chapter 27) |

#### The Go fork

```sh
cd typescript                    # from the repository root
vibelang/smoke.sh            # builds tsc (about 75 s cold), then compiles and runs every case
vibelang/smoke.sh vibelang-infer   # one case
```

| Case | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| `vibelang-wrap` | Functions lower to `Effect.fnUntraced` generators, and JavaScript runs them |
| `vibelang-lower` | Calls run by type: pure helpers stay plain, Effect-returning calls run, operands run left to right, and a `Config` stays data |
| `vibelang-infer` | Unannotated functions get `Effect<A, E, R>`: a typed failure flows from `lookup` into `main`, and the `.d.ts` declares it |

`typescript/VIBELANG.md` records the base, the 11 commits, the upstream lines it changes, and the differential check against the prototype.

### B. Prior art

`docs/research/continuation-prior-art.md` has the full notes, with quoted sources. Rule numbers refer to its final section.

| Question | Prior art | VibeLang |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Second resume | A runtime error everywhere it is checked: OCaml `Continuation_already_resumed`, Kotlin "Already resumed", Swift's checked continuation traps (6.4 rejects it at compile time), Loom "Continuation terminated", WasmFX traps. `Effect.callback` and Effection drop it silently | Defect at the caller (T2). Root waits keep first-wins and report the loss (rule 1) |
| Abandoned continuations | No system cleans them up from the GC; deterministic cleanup needs a handler or scope that owns the continuation: Koka's final yield, Effection's `return()`, OCaml's `discontinue`, WasmFX's `resume_throw` | Owner frames, Scope ownership, and the capturing fiber's exit; development-only leak reports (rules 3, 4) |
| Cancellation versus resumption | One take-once cell. Only Kotlin hands the losing value to a release hook (`onCancellation`) | Kernel `suspend` reports the loss and releases deferred values (T5b, K10b); `handoff` releases late values after producer quiescence (H2-H4) (rule 2) |
| `finally` in generated code | Effection loses a halt when a delegated `finally` performs an effect; Effect 4 never calls `return()` | Finalizers compile to Effect frames, never JavaScript `finally` (rule 5) |
| Dynamic state across resume | DDB in the delimited-control literature, Racket, and Koka; snapshot in TC39 AsyncContext (at each `await`, and a generator's creation-time context), Effect 4, Kotlin, Swift, and tokio | Snapshot, unlike the research recommendation (rule 6); Chapter 22 gives the reasons and the cost |
| Tail-resumptive operations | Run in place: 10× on Koka's counter benchmark, under the handler's evidence | Run in place under the caller's Context, as Effect services do; call-time lookups must be in the contract (Chapter 4). Differs from rule 7 on whose Context |
| Handler identity | Generative tags (WasmFX), labels (Koka), capabilities (Effekt) | Handler instances, found through Context evidence (rule 8) |
| Multi-shot | Excluded by every fiber or thread runtime; Kyo stays single-shot so it never re-enters a released bracket | Excluded (rule 9) |
| Foreign frames | Every system refuses to capture through them (OCaml `Unhandled`, js_of_ocaml, JSPI `SuspendError`, Racket barriers) | Rejected at compile time (EK4301, EK4202); unhandled at run time (rule 10) |
| Which code gets transformed | Selective: Koka cut CPS-translated functions by over 80%; Stopify measured generators at about 2× slower than exception-based capture | Frames only where capture or parking is reachable (Chapter 15; rule 11) |
| Cross-fiber resume | Kotlin and Swift always schedule | Bounded synchronous wake-ups (Chapter 24; rule 12) |
| Resumable handlers on Effect-TS or ZIO | None found by searches of npm, GitHub code (`fiber._stack`, `"~effect/Effect/successCont"`), and Effect issues and discussions on 2026-10-15. Effect's maintainer: generators "are only valid to express `one-shot` effect types" | No other implementation is known; this kernel is one-shot by design. The claim fails if a search turns one up |

#### TC39 proposals and VibeLang

Stages as fetched on 2026-10-16 (`docs/research/tc39-syntax.md`).

| Proposal | Stage | In VibeLang |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Explicit Resource Management (`using`) | 4 since 2026-05-19, for ES2027 | Adopted: `using` with Effect's guarantees (Chapter 6) |
| Pipeline operator (Hack `\|>`) | 2 since 2021-08; topic token undecided; "somewhat stuck" (January 2026) | In `.vibe` files with the topic `%`; a topic that stands for a program passes the left side by name (Chapter 5, D154, D155; supersedes D8) |
| AsyncContext | 2 | Prior art for the snapshot rule (Chapter 22). VibeLang code keeps request-scoped values in Effect's Context |
| Partial application (`f~(x, ?)`) | 1 | Not adopted. A function with no arguments is the program spelling (D7) |
| Pattern matching (`match`) | 1 | Adopted: `match` and `is`, with the supported pattern subset (Chapter 3, D206-D215) |
| Throw expressions | 2, unchanged since 2017 | Adopted: `throw` is a typed failure in statements and expressions (Chapter 3, D186) |
| Extractors | 2 | Adopted in match patterns, such as `Option.Some(let value)` (Chapter 3, D207) |
| Import defer | 3 | Not used. Deferring a module's evaluation doesn't change EK1001: its top level still can't run a program |
| Await dictionary (`Promise.allKeyed`) | 3 | Adopted for record-shaped `await.all` and `await.allSettled` (Chapter 7, D196) |
| Abort Controller, Concurrency control | 1 | Not adopted. Effect's interruption and `concurrency` options |
| F#-style pipes; `Function.pipe` and `flow` | Failed Stage 2; withdrawn | Not applicable |
