### 3. Errors: the E channel

#### Throwing a typed error

Errors are the tagged error classes you use today. `error InvalidId { raw: string }` is short for `class InvalidId extends TaggedError("InvalidId")<{ readonly raw: string }> {}`; `TaggedError`, Effect's `Data.TaggedError`, is in scope in every `.vibe` file. The tag is the class name, every field is readonly, and `error Timeout` declares an error without fields (D126). Errors that must be serialized use `Schema.TaggedError`. In an Effect function, `throw` adds the error to E.

```ts effect
class InvalidId extends Data.TaggedError("InvalidId")<{ readonly raw: string }> {}

const parseId = Effect.fn("parseId")(function* (raw: string) {
  if (!/^\d+$/.test(raw)) return yield* new InvalidId({ raw })
  return Number(raw)
})
```

```ts es
error InvalidId { raw: string }

function parseId(raw: string) {
  if (!/^\d+$/.test(raw)) throw new InvalidId({ raw })
  return Number(raw)
}
// number!InvalidId!
```

Callee errors flow up the same way: a function's E is everything it throws plus everything its callees can fail with, minus what it catches.

In an Effect function you can throw any value; it joins E with its static type, as with `Effect.fail`: `throw new Error("bad")` adds `Error`, and `throw "bad"` adds `string`. Tagged error classes are the convention because `catch` tells them apart with `instanceof` or `_tag`.

#### Catching

`try`/`catch` handles typed errors. The caught value's type is exactly the errors the `try` block can produce.

```ts effect
const lookup = Effect.fn("lookup")(function* (raw: string) {
  const id = yield* parseId(raw)
  const users = yield* Users
  return yield* users.find(String(id)).pipe(
    Effect.catchTag("UserNotFound", () => Effect.succeed(guest))
  )
})
```

```ts es
function lookup(raw: string) {
  const id = parseId(raw)
  try {
    return Users.find(String(id))
  } catch (e) {                // e: UserNotFound
    return guest
  }
}
// User!InvalidId!Users
```

To handle some errors and pass on the rest, catch the failure and test it with pattern matching (D216); `default: throw e` passes on the rest with their types:

```ts es
function lookupOrGuest(raw: string) {
  try {
    return Users.find(String(parseId(raw)))
  } catch (e) {
    return match (e) {
      when UserNotFound: guest;
      default: throw e;
    }
  }
}
// User!InvalidId!Users
```

An arm names an error class, or several with `or`, and tests for instances, so it also matches tagged errors from other packages, such as `Schema.SchemaError`. A `match` without `default` must handle every failure the `try` block can raise (EK4701), so a complete match needs no rethrow. As a statement, `if (e is UserNotFound) { ... }` tests one class, and TypeScript narrows `e` after it. The earlier catch clause that names a type, `catch (e: UserNotFound)` (D131), still compiles but is retired: it draws warning EK2112, whose quick fix writes the `match`.

#### Catching in an expression

`catch` also works after an expression (D236), like Zig's inline catch. `x catch fallback` runs `x` and, after an expected failure, evaluates the fallback instead, like `Effect.orElseSucceed`. `x catch (e) => handler` passes the expected failure to the handler, like `Effect.catch`:

```ts es
function nameOrGuest(id: string) {
  return Users.find(id).name catch "guest"
}
// string!!Users

function nameOrReason(raw: string) {
  return Users.find(String(parseId(raw))).name catch (e) => match (e) {
    when UserNotFound: "guest";
    when InvalidId: "invalid id";
  }
}
// string!!Users
```

The left side runs inside the catch; the fallback runs only when it fails. Defects and interrupts pass through, as with the statement. The value is the left side's or the handler's, and E is what the fallback or handler lets escape: the `match` above handles every failure, so none escapes; `default: throw e` would pass on the rest. `catch` binds looser than `??` and `||`, tighter than `? :` and assignment, and associates left, so `a() catch b() catch c` tries each in turn (D237). Effect's combinators still work, and a call in a program position is passed by name (D147): `Effect.catchTag(Users.find(id), "UserNotFound", () => guest)`.

#### Promising that nothing escapes

A contract with `never` in E promises every error is handled inside, and the compiler checks it.

```ts es
export function safeLookup(raw: string): User!!Users {
  try {
    return lookupOrGuest(raw)
  } catch (e) {                // e: InvalidId
    return guest
  }
}
```

Without the `try`, you get Chapter 2's error, `EK2001: InvalidId can escape safeLookup`.

#### Cleanup with `finally`

`finally` runs when the block exits in any way: success, failure, or interruption.

```ts effect
const report = Effect.fn("report")(
  function* (id: string) {
    const reports = yield* Reports
    return yield* reports.build(id)
  },
  Effect.ensuring(Metrics.use((metrics) => metrics.increment("reports")))
)
```

```ts es
function report(id: string) {
  try {
    return Reports.build(id)
  } finally {
    Metrics.increment("reports")
  }
}
```

For cleanup that acquires and releases a resource, use `using` (Chapter 6).

#### Failures, defects, and interruption

Effect distinguishes three ways a computation can stop, and VibeLang keeps them apart:

```ts es
function lookupAudited(id: string) {
  try {
    try {
      return Users.find(id)             // fails with UserNotFound
    } finally {
      Audit.flush()                     // and this crashes with a TypeError: a defect
    }
  } catch (e) {                         // does not run: the exit also carries a defect
    return guest
  }
}
```

`catch` handles an expected failure only when nothing else went wrong. Here the exit carries both the `UserNotFound` and the crash, so the `catch` block does not run and the whole failure propagates, crash included. `Effect.catch` would recover from this exit and drop the crash.

| What happened | Example | In E? | Caught by `catch`? | Runs `finally`? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Expected failure | `throw new InvalidId(…)`, a callee's E | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Defect: a bug | `(undefined as any).name` throws a `TypeError` | No | No | Yes |
| Interruption | a timeout, a cancelled request, a parent shutdown | No | No | Yes |
| An expected failure plus a defect | `lookupAudited` above | No: the failure becomes a defect (D305) | No: the whole exit propagates | Yes |
| An expected failure plus an interruption | a joined fiber, interrupted while its cleanup failed | Yes | Yes: `e` is the first, and the interruption is dropped (D306) | Yes |
| Several expected failures | both branches of `Effect.race` failed | Yes | Yes: `e` is the first | Yes |

`catch` does not catch bugs or cancellation, because that would hide them. Handle defects deliberately with Effect's tools at a boundary: `Effect.catchDefect(() => risky(), …)`. To declare an expected failure impossible here, make it a defect: `const id = Effect.orDie(() => parseId(raw))`. To see every failure in an exit, use `Effect.catchCause` or `Effect.exit`. Chapter 17 states the full rules.

#### Coming from `Effect.gen`

Two forms look the same but mean different things, on purpose.

**`throw` is `Effect.fail`.** Inside `Effect.gen`, `throw new Error("unreachable")` is a defect. In an Effect function, `throw` is a typed failure: `Error` joins E, and a `catch` can handle it. To signal a bug, die explicitly: `Effect.die(new Error("unreachable"))`.

**Effect `catch` sees expected failures only.** Inside `Effect.gen`, a JavaScript `catch` sees any synchronous exception from its `try`. In an Effect region, an exception no contract lists is a defect, and `catch` does not see it. That covers Effect's "cannot fail here" functions, such as `Option.getOrThrow` and `Schema.decodeUnknownSync`, whose exceptions are defects (Chapter 10); each has a form for code that can fail: `Option.getOrElse`, `Effect.fromOption`, `Schema.decodeUnknownEffect`. A function with a plain return annotation follows the same rule, because a plain function never fails (D282): its catch receives typed failures only. A catch whose try block has E = `never` reports EK2004, a warning by default; defects pass through it:

```ts es
function firstAdmin(users: ReadonlyArray<User>) {
  try {
    Effect.succeed(undefined)
    return Option.fromNullishOr(users.find(isAdmin)).getOrThrow()
  } catch (e) {
    return guest
  }
}
```

```text
warning EK2004: this try block runs Effects but has no expected errors; defects pass through this catch.
  admins.vibe:3:12   return Option.getOrThrow(Option.fromNullishOr(users.find(isAdmin)))
                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ its exceptions are defects
  Use a form that can fail:   return users.find(isAdmin) ?? guest
  or bound the call:          try(…, (cause) => new NoAdmin({ cause }))
```

#### Failing in an expression

`throw` also works as an expression (D186), as in the TC39 [throw expressions](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-throw-expressions) proposal. It fails exactly as the statement does and has type `never`:

```ts
error NoAdmin

function admin(users: ReadonlyArray<{ admin: boolean; name: string }>) {
  return users.find((user) => user.admin)?.name ?? throw new NoAdmin()
}
// string!NoAdmin!
```

Its operand is a unary expression, as in the proposal's grammar, so an operator after it applies to more than the throw. EK1010 refuses a throw that is, or ends, a binary operator's left operand (except comma), a conditional's condition, or the operand of `as` or `satisfies`: `x ?? throw c ? a : b` is `(x ?? throw c) ? a : b` and throws only `c`. Write `x ?? throw (c ? a : b)`.

#### Matching errors and outcomes

`match` and `is` come from the TC39 [pattern matching](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching) proposal (D206, D211). An `error` class is a pattern that matches its own instances (D215), and `Option`, `Exit`, and `Result` have matchers that bind their contents (D208):

```ts es
function describe(failure: NotFound | Timeout) {
  return match (failure) {
    when NotFound and { let id }: `no user ${id}`;
    when Timeout: "retry";
  }
}

function firstFailure(id: string) {
  const outcome = exit(getUser(id))
  if (outcome is Exit.Failure(let cause) && Cause.hasFails(cause)) return Cause.pretty(cause)
  return "ok"
}
```

A data type's variant is a pattern too (D307, Chapter 11): `when Delivery.Sent { let tracking }` tests the tag and binds the fields its braces list.

The parser writes both as conditionals TypeScript narrows, so each arm sees its own type and can call Effect functions (D214). Each reads its subject once, before any pattern, as `switch` reads its discriminant. A match without `default` over a finite union must cover every case: omitting `Timeout` above is EK4701 (D209). The same `match` handles a propagating failure, inside `catch (e)`, and a failure or Exit held as a value.
