### 10. Working with TypeScript

VibeLang uses the TypeScript compiler and shares its types, modules, and Effect. A project mixes `.ts` and `.vibe` files freely: existing Effect code stays in TypeScript, and new code goes in either.

#### Using TypeScript Effect code from VibeLang

A TypeScript function that returns an `Effect` is called like any VibeLang function: the call runs it, and its A, E, and R join the caller's contract unchanged.

```ts ts
// users-repo.ts
export const findUser = Effect.fn("findUser")(function* (id: string) {
  const db = yield* Database
  const rows = yield* db.query("select * from users where id = $1", [id])
  if (rows.length === 0) return yield* new UserNotFound({ id })
  return toUser(rows[0])
})
// (id: string) => Effect<User, UserNotFound | DbError, Database>
```

```ts es
// page.vibe
import { findUser } from "./users-repo.ts"

export function title(id: string) {
  return findUser(id).name.toUpperCase()
}
// string!UserNotFound | DbError!Database
```

Generic, overloaded, and aliased TypeScript functions keep their signatures. TypeScript services, `Context.Service` classes or values, are used exactly like abstract service classes: `Database.query(…)` works on either. The one exception is a TypeScript function whose R contains a control operation (EK4202, Chapter 9).

#### Generator-style code stays in TypeScript

Existing `Effect.gen` and `Effect.fn` code keeps working in `.ts` files, and VibeLang calls it as above. It cannot move into a `.vibe` file unchanged, because there `function*` declares a producer (Chapter 8), not a JavaScript generator:

```ts es
const findName = (id: string) => Effect.gen(function* () {
  const users = yield* Users
  const user = yield* users.find(id)
  return user.name
})
```

```text
error EK1002: Effect.gen expects a JavaScript generator, but in VibeLang function* declares a producer.
  Write the body as an ordinary function: remove Effect.gen, function*, and yield*.
    function findName(id: string) { return Users.find(id).name }
```

The same holds for `Option.gen`, `Result.gen`, and any other API that takes a generator. VibeLang has no `async` functions either: a call already waits, `join` waits for a fiber, `d.await()` for a Deferred, and `await` appears only in the await operations (Chapter 7, D225, D226). Converting a function is mostly deletion, as every chapter of Part I shows; the editor refactor remains a design target (Chapter 28).

#### Using VibeLang code from TypeScript

To TypeScript, an exported unannotated or Effect-contract function returns an `Effect`, and every exported producer is a function that returns a `Stream`. The compiler writes that into the declaration file:

```ts dts
// page.d.ts
export declare const title: (id: string) => Effect.Effect<string, UserNotFound | DbError, Database>
```

```ts ts
// server.ts
import { Effect } from "effect"
import { title } from "./page.js"

const program = title("42").pipe(Effect.provide(DatabaseLive))   // nothing has run yet
```

Calling a VibeLang function from TypeScript builds a program and runs nothing, like calling an `Effect.fn` function, even if it compiles to plain JavaScript (Chapter 15): TypeScript sees an unannotated `add` as `(a: number, b: number) => Effect<number>`, and VibeLang callers in the same compilation use the fast path. Two kinds run at the call. A factory (D269) explicitly returns a program under a declared Effect return type; its body runs at the call, and its returned program runs only when the caller runs it. An eligible helper with a plain annotation, such as `: number`, keeps a plain JavaScript signature and runs when TypeScript calls it (D67). TypeScript imports `./page.js`, which the compiler resolves to `page.vibe` the way it resolves `.js` to `.ts`.

#### Readonly members

An interface or an object type in a `.vibe` file has readonly members unless a member says `mutable` (D134):

```ts es
interface Cart {
  id: string
  mutable items: Array<string>
}
// interface Cart { readonly id: string; items: Array<string> }
```

The declaration file writes `readonly`, so TypeScript code sees the same types. Readonly limits writes through the type, not the object: TypeScript assigns a mutable object to a readonly type, so TypeScript passes its objects in unchanged. Index signatures follow the same rule. Class members and arrays keep TypeScript's rules: write `ReadonlyArray` or `readonly T[]` for an array the code must not change.

#### Code that is not Effect

A function that does not return an `Effect` is foreign code. Nothing in its type says whether it throws, what it reads, or whether it touches the outside world, so each kind of callee has a rule:

```ts es
import { slugify } from "./slug.ts"          // exported through trusted()

function publish(draft: Draft) {
  const meta = JSON.parse(draft.frontMatter)  // a built-in: SyntaxError joins E
  const slug = slugify(meta.title)            // trusted(): lists InvalidSlug
  const words = draft.body.split(/\s+/).length
  return Articles.save({ slug, words, ...meta })
}
// Article!SyntaxError | InvalidSlug | SaveError!Articles
```

| Callee | Rule | Diagnostic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A function returning `Effect`, from VibeLang or TypeScript | Calls run it | |
| A JavaScript built-in: `String`, `Array`, `Math`, `JSON`, `Number`, `Object`, `Map`, `Set`, `RegExp`, deterministic `Date` parsing | Ships with a trusted contract: a control class, and which exceptions are expected failures. Only built-ins that parse outside text declare any: `JSON.parse` fails with `SyntaxError`, `decodeURI` and `decodeURIComponent` with `URIError`; other built-in exceptions are defects (D101) | |
| An export of `effect` or an `@effect/*` package that does not return an `Effect`, and the functions and values it returns, such as a `Brand` constructor or the function `Match.exhaustive` returns | Trusted: `sync`; its exceptions are defects, as inside `Effect.gen` today | |
| A function wrapped with `trusted(impl, [Errors])` from `vibelang-runtime` | Returns an `Effect`; listed exception classes are expected failures, and any other exception is a defect (D249) | |
| A platform API: `node:*` modules and browser globals such as `fetch`, `setTimeout`, `process`, `console`, `localStorage` | Not callable from `.vibe` files; the error names the Effect service to use, its import, and the layer that provides it (Chapter 11) | EK4402 |
| A clock or randomness read: `Date.now()`, `new Date()`, `Math.random()`, `crypto.randomUUID()` | Use `Clock`, `DateTime`, `Random`, and `Crypto`, so tests control them | EK4403 |
| Any other plain TypeScript or JavaScript function | Needs an explicit boundary or a trusted contract | EK4401 |
| A value of type `any` | An ordinary JavaScript call returns the result without running it as a program (D24). Calling a non-callable Effect value raises a `TypeError`, a defect. Where an Effect function or a program returns the call's result, a program in that result would never run | EK4409 (warning) |

A trusted contract is a value declared beside the TypeScript implementation (D249):

```ts ts
// slug.ts
import { trusted } from "vibelang-runtime"
import { InvalidSlug } from "./errors.ts"

function slugifyImpl(title: string): string { … }
export const slugify = trusted(slugifyImpl, [InvalidSlug])
```

`trusted` keeps the implementation's parameters and returns an `Effect`. An exception that is an instance of a listed class joins E. Any other exception is a defect. The compiler cannot check the TypeScript body, so the wrapper states its contract once. A package listed in the tsconfig's `vibelang.trustedPackages` is also trusted (D261).

The D23 tags `@vibelang trusted` and `@throws` are deprecated. The native compiler still reads them, but reports EK4406 when their contract affects lowering in an Effect function outside a hatch. Migrate the declaration to `trusted(impl, [Errors])`. The planned per-file emitter cannot read another file's tags, so such calls become errors when that emitter replaces the native lowering (D249).

EK4401 applies where a fiber runs the code. Module initialization and its plain callbacks passed to TypeScript, such as `describe` bodies and route handlers, run ordinary JavaScript calls (D100). An exception at module top level fails the import. Trusted failures stay defects inside plain callbacks, while they make free lambdas and named VibeLang functions use the Effect form (D101).

An explicit boundary, one of the hatches `sync`, `try`, and `callback` (D148), says what an exception means at the call:

```ts es
function parseLegacy(text: string) {
  return try((text) => legacyParse(text), (cause) => new LegacyFormatError({ cause }), text)   // plain TypeScript inside
}
// LegacyDoc!LegacyFormatError!
```

`try` turns an exception or a rejection into a typed error: `UnknownError`, or what its second argument makes of it. `sync` makes them defects. `callback` adapts a callback API (Chapter 6). Each takes either a function, `try(() => { … })` or `try(async (signal) => …)`, or a single expression evaluated when the Effect runs, `sync(crypto.randomUUID())`. A hatch's first argument is plain TypeScript, not VibeLang: calls there do not run, so calling a `.vibe` function gives an inert Effect value for `runPromise` or `runFork`; `throw`, `async`, and `await` keep their JavaScript meaning; platform APIs and clock reads are allowed (no EK4401, EK4402, or EK4403); and `return` returns from the hatch's function. Effect's `{ try, catch }` options object is EK4404: the hatch takes the code and the error mapping as two arguments.

That TypeScript is self-contained (D229). It may use its own parameters and locals, globals, imports, and the file's error declarations, but no other binding of the `.vibe` file: not a local, a parameter, or a module declaration. A value reaches it as an input (D230), an argument after the function that fills the function's first parameters, as `text` does above. An async function receives its `AbortSignal` after the inputs, in a parameter it declares to take one, and a callback's register function receives `resume` and the signal after them. `try`'s error mapper stays the second argument, so inputs follow it (D231). Only the first argument is TypeScript: the mapper and the inputs are VibeLang, so a call among the inputs runs before the hatch starts, and the mapper may read the file's bindings, as `cartId` below (D232). A binding read from outside is EK4405 (quick fix: pass it as an input). A `.vibe` function is a binding too, so a hatch that leads back in takes it as an input: `sync(async (load) => runPromise(load()), loadReport)`. Inputs keep `callback`'s type arguments from being written, so its `resume` parameter takes the prelude type instead: `callback((source, resume: Resume<number, Error>) => …, source)`.

The rule is deliberately strict, so a hatch's function reads like a standalone TypeScript function and could move to a `.ts` file unchanged; a later version may relax it.

`runPromise`, `runFork`, `runSync`, and `runCallback` are in the prelude as the way back in, called from plain TypeScript (a `.ts` file, a hatch's body, or a module's top level), never from code a fiber runs (EK1005).

An exception that no contract lists is a defect, and an Effect catch does not see it, unlike JavaScript catch inside `Effect.gen`. That includes the exceptions of Effect's "cannot fail here" functions, such as `Option.getOrThrow` and `Schema.decodeUnknownSync`, which `effect`'s trusted contracts classify as defects. A plain function's catch does not see it either (D282) (Chapter 3).

JavaScript, not VibeLang, sets a boundary's limits: it cannot discover a dependency the function reaches through a global or a module variable, cancel synchronous JavaScript once started, or let a synchronous callback pause. Effect code today has the same limits.

This changes policy from the original direction, which adapted every plain call automatically, with unknown errors and unknown requirements. The premise stays: foreign code is untrusted until something vouches for it. The vouching now happens once, explicitly, at a boundary or on a declaration, so an unprovidable `unknown` never enters a requirement and an `unknown` error never spreads to every caller. Pure helpers written in `.vibe` get inferred contracts and compile to plain JavaScript (Chapter 15), so most project code never needs a boundary.

#### Promises

Outside a hatch, `await` appears only in the await operations (D226), so a Promise from a TypeScript library is waited on with the `try` hatch, which says what a rejection means and passes an `AbortSignal` so interruption can cancel the request:

```ts es
import { createCharge } from "./payments-sdk.ts"   // (amount: number, signal: AbortSignal) => Promise<Charge>

function charge(cartId: string, amount: number) {
  return try((amount, signal) => createCharge(amount, signal), (cause) => new ChargeFailed({ cartId, cause }), amount)
}
// Charge!ChargeFailed!
```

HTTP itself goes through Effect's `HttpClient`, not `fetch` (Chapter 11).

#### Callbacks into plain JavaScript

A JavaScript function such as `Array.prototype.map` calls its callback synchronously, so the callback cannot pause. A callback that only computes is fine, as is a VibeLang function passed by name that compiles to plain JavaScript. A callback that calls a service is rejected, with the fix in the message:

```ts es
const trimmed = ids.map((id) => id.trim())         // fine
const users = ids.map((id) => Users.find(id))      // rejected
```

```text
error EK4301: this callback can pause (Users.find), but Array.prototype.map calls it
  synchronously. Use Effect.forEach(ids, (id) => Users.find(id)) or a for...of loop.
```

Effect's own combinators, such as `Effect.forEach`, expect callbacks that return Effects, so VibeLang callbacks work there; Chapter 16 gives the rules for higher-order functions.

#### Effect 3

VibeLang targets Effect 4 only; Effect 3 values do not run on the Effect 4 runtime. Code that must call an Effect 3 library wraps it as foreign code, for example with the `try` hatch around `Effect3.runPromise`: `try((program) => Effect3.runPromise(program), (error) => …, program)`.
