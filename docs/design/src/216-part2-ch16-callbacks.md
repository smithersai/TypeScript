### 16. Callbacks and higher-order functions

#### A callback type without a contract accepts any contract

```ts es
function mapAll<A, B>(items: ReadonlyArray<A>, f: (a: A) => B) {
  const out: B[] = []
  for (const item of items) out.push(f(item))
  return out
}
// <A, B, E, R>(items: ReadonlyArray<A>, f: (a: A) => B!E!R) => B[]!E!R

const names = mapAll(ids, (id) => Users.find(id).name)   // string[]!UserNotFound!Users
const sizes = mapAll(words, (w) => w.length)             // number[]!!
```

`f`'s type says nothing about errors or services, so `mapAll` passes through whatever its callback does: a missing contract on a callback parameter means "inferred from each call's argument", never "cannot fail, needs nothing". To restrict a callback, write its contract: `f: (a: A) => B!!`. D12 stands alongside D57: `infer` selects inferred channels in the return annotation of a function with a body, but introduces no inference in parameter types or aliases. In a callback parameter, `(a: A) => Effect<B>` keeps TypeScript's defaults, meaning `(a: A) => Effect<B, never, never>`, while `(a: A) => B` accepts any contract.

The rule also covers declarations, methods, and function expressions that are not call arguments. Added channel parameters are named E and R, then E2 and R2 for another callback (D68), and default to `never`, so a call that omits an optional callback adds no failure and needs nothing. An optional call, `f?.(a)`, runs the callback when it is present, as `f(a)` does.

The rule follows the language a function type is written in, not how it is spelled (D331). A function type written in a `.vibe` file gains the channels, whether it is written in place or through a type alias or an interface that a `.vibe` file declares: an alias means what the type it names means, so extracting one changes nothing.

```ts es
type Visit = (node: Node) => void

function walkAll(nodes: ReadonlyArray<Node>, visit: Visit) {
  for (const node of nodes) visit(node)
}
// <E, R>(nodes: ReadonlyArray<Node>, visit: (node: Node) => void!E!R) => void!E!R
```

A function type that TypeScript declares, in a `.ts` file, a library, or a `module` declaration (D283), keeps TypeScript's meaning wherever it is used: a plain function. `Predicate.Predicate<T>` and `LazyArg<A>` are such types. A contract-less callback can pause and has no plain form, so it cannot be called inside a synchronous JavaScript callback such as a `sort` comparator, or passed on as one, as in `xs.find(p)`: either is EK4301. Call it in a `for...of` loop instead, or give the parameter a plain function type that TypeScript declares, such as `Predicate.Predicate<T>`.

The declaration file writes the polymorphism out, as the comment shows, so a TypeScript caller passes a callback returning an `Effect` and wraps a plain one: `mapAll(words, (w) => Effect.succeed(w.length))`.

`mapAll` compiles to frames in v0 whatever its callback does (Chapter 15). The same rule makes wrappers short:

```ts es
function withRetry<A>(times: number, program: () => A) {
  return retry(program, Schedule.recurs(times))
}
// <A, E, R>(times: number, program: () => A!E!R) => A!E!R
```

#### Callbacks into JavaScript

A JavaScript function such as `Array.prototype.map` calls its callback synchronously, on a stack frame the runtime cannot pause or capture. A callback passed where a plain function type is expected must therefore compile to plain JavaScript (Chapter 15), with no Effect operation and E = `never`; anything else is EK4301 (Chapter 10). The same holds for a named VibeLang function passed as a value: `stores.map(makeSync)` passes `makeSync`'s plain form, and a function without one is rejected.

#### Which Effect combinators run their argument on another fiber

A control operation must be handled on the fiber that performs it (Chapter 9), so the compiler needs to know whether each Effect function that takes a program runs it on the same fiber. These were measured by performing a control operation inside each combinator, with the handler outside (`tests/fiber-behavior.test.ts`):

```ts es
try {
  retry(() => Approval.approve("a"), Schedule.recurs(2))     // same fiber: reaches the handler
  timeout(() => Approval.approve("b"), "1 second")           // other fiber: EK4201
} handle Approval.approve(_request) {
  resume(true)
}
```

| Same fiber: a handler outside still works | Other fibers: handle control operations inside |
| --- | --- |
| `flatMap`, `map`, `catch`, `catchCause`, `ensuring`, `onExit`, `provideService`, `scoped`, `acquireRelease` (acquire), `acquireUseRelease` (use), `retry`, `repeat`, `uninterruptible`, sequential `forEach` and `all`, `zip` by default | Measured: `timeout`, `race`, `raceFirst`, `forEach` with concurrency 2, unbounded `all`, `zip` with `concurrent: true`, `forkChild`. From source: `forkIn`, `forkScoped`, `forkDetach`, `Layer.merge` builds, parallel Scope finalizers, a producer converted to a `Stream` (Chapter 8) |

`timeout` is on the right because it runs its program on a child fiber to race it against the clock. For an Effect function outside this table, the compiler assumes the argument may run on another fiber.

The runtime is the guarantee and the table is the diagnostic. A control operation that reaches another fiber fails at run time with `HandlerNotOnThisFiber` (T7b, T8), never silently. The table turns that defect into a compile-time error where it can, and a combinator missing from it costs a conservative error, not a wrong program.

TypeScript functions are judged by their signatures, because a TypeScript function can fork inside its body without taking a program argument: a TypeScript function whose R contains a control operation is EK4202 (Chapter 9). Services need no such check: their implementations live in the Context, which every forked fiber inherits.

The rule is conservative in one case. TypeScript code can implement a control operation so that it always continues exactly once; that implementation runs in place like a service and would work on a forked fiber. The compiler cannot see that from VibeLang, so it treats every control operation as bound to its fiber.
