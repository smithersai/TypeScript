# Effect's Modules

In `.vibe` files, Effect's modules are already in scope: the prelude, every module `effect` exports from its root, such as `Console`, `Option`, `Stream`, `Schedule`, `Clock`, and `Duration`, and every module of its subpath packages, such as `HttpRouter` from `effect/http`, `ChildProcess` from `effect/process`, and `TestClock` from `effect/testing`. Platform packages such as `@effect/platform-node` still need imports.

## Install the core package

```sh
npm install effect@4.0.6
```

The core package supplies Effect's data types, schedules, concurrency tools, and other modules. See [Installation](004-installation.md) for platform packages, `vibelang`, and `vibelang-runtime`.

## Module and namespace imports

```vibe
// run: Console.log(Number.isFinite(pauseBeforeRetry()))
function pauseBeforeRetry() {
  const started = Clock.currentTimeMillis()
  sleep(Duration.millis(25))
  return started
}

const backoff = Schedule.exponential("50 millis")
// Output: true
```

`Effect`, the `Effect<A, E, R>` type, `Schema`, `Layer`, `Scope`, `TaggedError`, and `Control` need no import; in a contract, `Scope` means Effect's `Scope.Scope`, as in `File!IOError!Scope`. The prelude also includes `pipe`, `wire`, `fork`, `handle`, `resume`, `resumeWith`, and `abandon`; the boundary hatches `sync`, `try`, and `callback`; the runners `runPromise`, `runFork`, `runSync`, and `runCallback`; and the Effect module's most used functions without the `Effect.` prefix: `sleep`, `log`, `logDebug`, `logInfo`, `logWarning`, `logError`, `retry`, `repeat`, `timeout`, `all`, `forEach`, `race`, `withSpan`, and `die`. Other Effect functions keep the prefix, as in `Effect.result(work())`. `flow` and `identity` need no import either.

JavaScript's own globals keep their names: `Array`, `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Symbol`, `BigInt`, `Function`, and `RegExp` mean JavaScript's, so import Effect's modules of those names under another name:

```vibe
// run: Console.log(JSON.stringify(firstTwo([1, 2, 3])))
import { Array as Arr } from "effect"

function firstTwo(values: ReadonlyArray<number>) {
  return Arr.take(values, 2)
}
// Output: [1,2]
```

Shared web-standard globals also keep their names: `Request`, `Response`, `Headers`, `URL`, `URLSearchParams`, `TextEncoder`, `TextDecoder`, `AbortController`, `AbortSignal`, `Blob`, `FormData`, `structuredClone`, `fetch`, and `Event`. So `new Request("https://x.test")` is the web Request; write `import { Request } from "effect"` for Effect's module. DOM-only globals do not shadow Effect's modules: with the DOM in your `lib`, `Option` is still Effect's. An import or local declaration named like a module shadows it, as `import * as Duration from "effect/Duration"` would. Value constructors such as `Duration.millis` build data; `Clock.currentTimeMillis()` and `Effect.sleep(...)` run computations. Effect's own packages are trusted: their data functions need no foreign-call boundary, and their exceptions are defects.

## Modules of subpath packages

A subpath package's modules need no import either. The emitted JavaScript imports each module you use from its own file, such as `effect/encoding/Hex`, so a program loads only what it uses:

```vibe
// run: Console.log(hexOf("hi"))
function hexOf(text: string) {
  return Hex.encode(new TextEncoder().encode(text))
}
// Output: 6869
```

Four rules settle a name that two globals share, in order: a JavaScript or shared web global wins; a root module wins over a subpath module; when two subpath packages have a module of the same name, neither is in scope, so import the one you mean; and an import or local declaration shadows any of them. These are the names they settle for `effect@4.0.6`:

<!-- D310 collisions: TestEffectNameCollisionsDocumented checks this table -->
| Name | Modules | Without an import |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Event` | `effect/eventlog` | the JavaScript or web global (rule 1) |
| `Headers` | `effect/http` | the JavaScript or web global (rule 1) |
| `Model` | `effect/ai`, `effect/schema` | nothing: import the one you mean (rule 3) |
| `Prompt` | `effect/ai`, `effect/cli` | nothing: import the one you mean (rule 3) |
| `Response` | `effect/ai` | the JavaScript or web global (rule 1) |
| `Transferable` | `effect/workers` | Effect's module; the DOM declares only a type |
| `Utils` | `effect`, `effect/rpc` | `effect`'s root module (rule 2) |
| `Worker` | `effect/workers` | Effect's module: the DOM's global loses |
<!-- end D310 collisions -->

## Compose standalone functions

```vibe
// run: Console.log(expirationWindow())
function expirationWindow() {
  const short = Duration.seconds(15)
  return short.toMillis()
}
// number!!
// Output: 15000
```

Effect exposes operations as module functions: call them with their data argument, or use their curried form in `pipe` where one exists. An Effect pipeline starts with a program, as in `pipe(() => work(), Effect.timeout("1 second"))`.

## Bundling unused code

Named module imports and direct namespace imports both expose the library without adding methods to your objects. Bundlers can drop unused exports when their module analysis supports it. The import spelling alone guarantees no particular size; check the generated bundle when size matters.

VibeLang's global names are source conveniences: they refer to Effect and language support code, which still participates in the emitted module graph.

## Reusable operators

```vibe
// run: Console.log(example())
function withinSecond<A, E, R>(program: () => A!E!R) {
  return timeout(program, "1 second")
}

function example() {
  return withinSecond {
    sleep("10 millis")
    return "ready"
  }
}
// Output: ready
```

A helper can take a program and apply library operators to it. Its contract keeps the program's errors and services and here adds `TimeoutError`. This extends your application without changing Effect's prototypes.

## Coming from Effect

Skip imports from `effect`'s root in `.vibe`. In `.ts` integration files, import `Effect`, `Layer`, and the other names you use as usual.
