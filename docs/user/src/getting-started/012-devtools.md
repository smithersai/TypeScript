# Devtools

Compiler diagnostics show VibeLang contracts and catch failures or requirements that escape a function's promise. The `vibelang` compiler and its language server check `.vibe` and `.ts` files together.

## Install language tooling

```vibe
// example.vibe
// run: Console.log(sample())
function sample() {
  sleep("5 millis")
  return "sample"
}
// string!!
// Output: sample
```

Install `vibelang` as a dev dependency. `vibelang --lsp --stdio` starts the language server from the project's compiler, one server for `.vibe` and `.ts` files.

For VS Code and Cursor, install the extension that ships in `vibelang`, then open the application directory:

```sh
code --install-extension node_modules/vibelang/editor/vibelang.vsix
# Or, for Cursor:
cursor --install-extension node_modules/vibelang/editor/vibelang.vsix
```

The extension is not on the VS Code Marketplace or Open VSX yet; reinstall it from `node_modules` after you update `vibelang`.

Other editors configure their LSP client to run `vibelang --lsp --stdio` for `*.vibe` and `*.ts`, with `tsconfig.json` as the root marker. Turn off the other TypeScript server for this project to avoid duplicate diagnostics. JetBrains IDEs can use LSP4IJ.

For GitHub highlighting, add `*.vibe linguist-language=TypeScript` to `.gitattributes`; the starter's `.gitattributes` already has this line. Effect's own `@effect/tsgo` tooling remains for `.ts` files and does not check VibeLang semantics.

## Inspect inferred information

```vibe
// run: Console.log(accepted(2))
error Rejected

function accepted(value: number) {
  if (value < 0) throw new Rejected()
  return value + 1
}
// number!Rejected!
// Output: 3
```

Inspect `A`, `E`, and `R` when changing a function. A local call returns the success value; the function's complete contract also records escaping failures and unmet services, and generated declarations expose it to TypeScript consumers.

Hover over a function to see its inferred `Effect<A, E, R>`, and over a call to see its success value's type. Separate control-class hover text is planned but not shipped.

## Diagnostics, completions, and refactors

```vibe
// expect-error: EK2001
// Rejected escapes a contract promising no failures.
function promised(value: number): number!! {
  return accepted(value)
}
```

This is `EK2001`: handle `Rejected` inside the function or widen its contract. Related checks: unmet services (`EK2002`), running a program at module top level without an explicit Effect type on a `const` (`EK1001`), and passing a suspending callback to synchronous JavaScript (`EK4301`).

Inside functions, plain foreign calls need a boundary hatch such as `try` or `sync`, or a trusted declaration (`EK4401`). Effect's own packages and packages matching the `vibelang` setting `trustedPackages` are trusted: plain calls are synchronous, their exceptions are defects, and Effect-returning calls run. A Node.js or web I/O global, run or held as a value, and a Node.js module imported as a value are rejected with the Effect service that replaces them (`EK4402`, D310), and uncontrolled time or randomness reads have their own diagnostic (`EK4403`). A runner inside code a fiber runs is `EK1005`, and a try block that runs Effects with E = `never` gets `EK2004` (defects pass through), a warning by default.

EK1010 refuses an unparenthesized throw expression that is, or ends, the left operand of a binary operator (except comma), a conditional's condition, or the operand of `as` or `satisfies`: `x ?? throw c ? a : b` throws only `c`. Write `throw (…)` to throw the whole expression; `value ?? throw e` and throw statements keep their meaning.

The server exposes TypeScript completions through the VibeLang checker, service member types included. Quick fixes repair retired spellings and the mechanical cases of Effect's language service rules (below); refactors write a function's inferred contract, convert an `async` function or an interface, and convert between calls and pipes (D245). Catch-specific completions are not implemented. Other diagnostic messages suggest repairs as text. Do not apply a TypeScript refactor that introduces `Effect.gen` or `yield*` inside `.vibe`.

## Configure compiler checks

```vibe
// run: Console.log(checked(2))
function checked(value: number): number!Rejected! {
  return accepted(value)
}
// Output: 3
```

A contract gives the compiler a promise to check. To infer selected channels, write `infer Name` in those slots: `Effect<number, Rejected, infer R>` checks success and failure and infers requirements. A type argument left out of `Effect<…>` is `never`, as in TypeScript, so `Effect<number>` is `number!!`. Configure the compiler with a `vibelang` object at the top level of `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "sourceMap": true
  },
  "vibelang": {
    "diagnostics": { "EK2004": "warning", "EK4403": "error" },
    "tracing": "exported",
    "trustedPackages": ["@acme/*"]
  }
}
```

A config that `extends` another inherits its `vibelang` settings, as it inherits compiler options. TypeScript, typescript-eslint, and editors' TypeScript servers ignore the top-level object. `compilerOptions.vibelang` is also accepted, but those tools reject it as an unknown compiler option (TS5023), so keep the settings at the top level (D275).

Each `.vibe` file keeps the settings of the package that owns it (D297). When a project reads another workspace package's `.vibe` source, as a project that imports that package does, the checker applies that package's settings, from the nearest `tsconfig.json` above the file, to the file's trust, diagnostics, and tracing. The importing project's settings apply to the files of its own package. A package therefore names the packages it trusts once, in its own `tsconfig.json`, and every project that imports it checks its source as the package's own build does.

EK1012, EK1016, EK2004, EK3205, EK4403, EK4406, EK4409, Effect's language service rules, EK4801-EK4825 except EK4813, and the TypeScript-style forms below, EK4830-EK4837, can be set to `"error"`, `"warning"`, or `"off"`; the values shown are EK2004's and EK4403's defaults. With EK4403 lowered, those reads compile as trusted synchronous calls that tests cannot control. Migration diagnostics such as EK2112 for retired typed catch clauses are warnings with fixed severity; core language errors have fixed severity too. `@ts-expect-error` does not suppress EK diagnostics. `vibelang` exits non-zero on any error and reports source locations. `tracing` accepts `"none"` (the default), `"exported"`, or `"all"` to add function spans.

`trustedPackages` accepts package-name globs matched against `package.json` names, workspace packages included. The whole name must match; `*`, `?`, and character classes match within each slash-delimited segment, so `"@acme/*"` trusts packages in that scope. Without the option, foreign calls keep EK4401. For expected failures on one function, use `trusted(impl, [Errors])` from `vibelang-runtime`, in TypeScript or VibeLang.

## TypeScript-style Effect code

Effect declarations and combinator calls written in TypeScript's style compile in a `.vibe` file, and draw a warning where VibeLang has a form of its own (D284-D290). Rewrite `Effect.gen` bodies as functions using ordinary calls instead of `yield*`. The warning's quick fix writes that form when it keeps what the program does; otherwise the warning's note says what the form would change, and there is no fix.

| Code | TypeScript style | VibeLang form | Quick fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EK4830 | `class NotFound extends Data.TaggedError("NotFound")<{ readonly id: string }> {}` | `error NotFound { id: string }` | When the tag is the class name and the base is a TaggedError; a different tag or `Data.Error` keeps the warning without one |
| EK4831 | `class Users extends Context.Service<Users, { find(id: string): Effect.Effect<User> }>()("app/Users") {}` | `service Users { find(id: string): User!! }` | When the members are written in the type argument; the key becomes the one the compiler derives |
| EK4832 | `const User = Schema.Struct({ id: Schema.String })` | `schema User { id: string }` | When every field has a declaration form; `Schema.optionalKey` or a check keeps the constant, without a warning |
| EK4833 | `Effect.Effect<User, NotFound, Db>` | `User!NotFound!Db` | Except for `infer` in a slot other than a function's dependencies; the prelude's `Effect<User, NotFound, Db>` draws no warning |
| EK4834 | `return Effect.succeed(user)`, `return Effect.fail(error)`, where the call runs | `return user`, `throw error` | When the function stays an Effect function |
| EK4835 | `Effect.catchTag(find(id), "NotFound", (e) => …)` | `find(id) catch (e) => match (e) { when NotFound: …; default: throw e; }` | When each handler is an arrow function with one value |
| EK4836 | `Effect.withSpan(load(), "load")`, `Effect.provide(main(), AppLive)` | `withSpan("load") { return load() }`, `provide AppLive { return main() }` | Where a block can stand |
| EK4837 | `class Failed extends Schema.TaggedError<Failed>()("Failed", { … }) {}` | `error Failed { … }`, which is not a Schema | None; turn the code off where errors are Schemas by design |

Apply every fix in a project, then compile as the rest of the command says:

```sh
npx vibelang -p tsconfig.json --fix --noEmit
```

`--fix` also applies the quick fixes of the retired spellings: EK1009, EK2112, EK2113, EK2120, and EK2121. Then it writes what the prelude makes shorter (D310, D311): it removes an import of one of Effect's modules under its own name, as `import * as Console from "effect/Console"`, `import { HttpRouter } from "effect/http"`, or `import { FileSystem } from "effect/FileSystem"` are, writing a use the module's name cannot stand for as `FileSystem.FileSystem`; and it writes `M.M` as `M` where the module's name means its export: `FileSystem.FileSystem.readFileString(path)` becomes `FileSystem.readFileString(path)`, and the type `Option.Option<number>` becomes `Option<number>`. The report counts these as `prelude import` and `module export`. It prints each file it changes, with its fixes by code, and writes the files only after it checks the fixed program: a fix that would add an error is listed as not fixed, and the file keeps its other fixes. Interrupted, it writes nothing. It fixes only what the project reports, so the `diagnostics` setting and the comments below choose what it touches; `// @vibelang-diagnostics-next-line EK4833:off` keeps one line as written. It rewrites only the project's own files: a workspace dependency's `.vibe` source that the project imports through its package keeps its text, and the compilation still reports its diagnostics. A second run finds nothing to fix. `--fix` cannot be combined with `--build` or `--watch`.

## Effect language service rules

The table accounts for the 108 diagnostics and editor features in `@effect/language-service` 0.87.5 (D240). Many rules address forms VibeLang replaces: there is no `Effect.gen` to misuse, a call already runs, and `catch` catches failures. Existing EK diagnostics cover others. The remaining checks are EK4801-EK4825, with mechanical quick fixes, alongside refactors, hovers, and completions. The table also marks features not implemented.

EK4801-EK4825 are lint. Each has a default, error, warning, or off, and all but EK4813 can be set in the `vibelang` setting `diagnostics` or by a comment (D241). A later comment overrides an earlier one; within one comment, a code named on its own overrides `*`. Words after the codes are prose, and punctuation ends a category, so `// @vibelang-diagnostics-next-line EK4801:off: returned unrun` keeps its reason:

```vibe
// run: Console.log(discard(() => { Console.log("unused") ; return 42 }))
function discard(program: Effect.Effect<number>) {
  // @vibelang-diagnostics-next-line EK4801:off
  program
  return 0
}
// Output: 0
```

`// @vibelang-diagnostics EK4818:warning` applies from its line to the end of the file; `*` names every adjustable code. EK diagnostics report only in `.vibe` files; a `.ts` file keeps TypeScript's verdict (D266). For Effect's rules in `.ts` files, use Effect's own TypeScript 7 server, `@effect/tsgo`.

## Debug stack traces

Build with `"sourceMap": true` in `compilerOptions`, then run `node --enable-source-maps dist/main.js`. Source maps translate JavaScript locations to `.vibe` locations. They do not record the logical caller chain.

Function tracing defaults to `"none"`. A defect can therefore show only one frame, even with source maps enabled. Set `"vibelang": { "tracing": "exported" }` at the top level of `tsconfig.json` to add spans for exported functions, or use `"all"` to include local functions. Rebuild after changing it. Add `withSpan("checkout") { ... }` around work that needs a meaningful operation name. More spans add runtime work.

The default Node runner can exit with only `Error: message`. For a debugging run, call your application's exported `main` from a TypeScript entry and print the rejected error's stack:

```ts
// debug.ts
// fragment
import { Effect } from "effect"
import { main } from "./main.vibe"

Effect.runPromise(main()).catch((error: unknown) => {
  console.error(error instanceof Error ? error.stack : error)
  throw error
})
```

Include `debug.ts` in the project, compile it with `vibelang`, then run `node --enable-source-maps dist/debug.js`. Importing `main.vibe` does not start its default runner. This entry prints the underlying JavaScript stack and rethrows to preserve the failure exit status. Tracing and named spans add logical Effect call context.

## Lint and build integration

Type-check with `vibelang --noEmit`. The compiler owns type and language diagnostics in the terminal, editor, and Vite overlay. The local `vibelang-vite` package supports Vite 7 and 8 and Vitest 5. It runs one whole-project compiler subprocess on the first request and after edits, serves JavaScript and source maps, and invalidates loaded `.vibe` modules and their importers; it does not use `vibelang --api`.

```ts
// TypeScript (.ts)
// vitest.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config"
import vibelang from "vibelang-vite"

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [vibelang()],
  test: { include: ["src/**/*.test.vibe"] }
})
```

The starter already includes this configuration. `bun run test` checks and compiles source tests without a prior build. See [TestClock](../testing/063-testclock.md) for tests with virtual time.

Lint `.vibe` files with ESLint through `vibelang/eslint`, the parser the `vibelang` package ships (D277). The compiler parses each file, so every VibeLang form is accepted, and ESLint gets the tree typescript-eslint gives it for TypeScript: typescript-eslint's rules and plugins such as `eslint-plugin-import`, `eslint-plugin-jsdoc`, and `eslint-plugin-unicorn` apply unchanged. Install `eslint` and `typescript-eslint` 8 beside `vibelang`; the parser uses typescript-eslint's scope analysis.

```js
// eslint.config.js
import tseslint from "typescript-eslint"
import vibelang from "vibelang/eslint"

export default tseslint.config({
  files: ["src/**/*.vibe"],
  extends: [tseslint.configs.recommended],
  languageOptions: { parser: vibelang }
})
```

Reports, fixes, and `// eslint-disable-next-line` comments land on the `.vibe` text. Rules that need type information, such as `@typescript-eslint/no-unnecessary-type-assertion`, cannot run on a `.vibe` file, since no TypeScript program loads one: enable them for `.ts` files only and check types with `vibelang --noEmit`. EK4801-EK4825 stay in the compiler and the language server. To see the tree a rule reads, run `vibelang --estree main.vibe < main.vibe`.

Forms whose TypeScript long form would mislead a rule have their own node types, which rules and `no-restricted-syntax` selectors can name:

| Form | ESTree node |
| --- | --- |
| `A!E!R` | `VibeEffectType` with `success`, `failure`, and `requirements` |
| `A!infer E`, outside a conditional type | `VibeInferType` with `name` |
| `x \|> f(%)` | `VibePipeExpression` with `left` and `right`; `%` is `TopicReference` |
| `x catch fallback`, `x catch (e) => recover(e)` | `VibeCatchExpression` with `expression` and `handler` |
| `provide AppLive, Random = seeded { ... }` | `VibeProvideStatement` with `providers` and `body`; `Random = seeded` is `VibeServiceProvider` |
| `uninterruptible { ... }`, `restore { ... }`, `interruptible { ... }` | `VibeMaskStatement` with `kind` and `body` |
| `module text { ... }` | `VibeModuleDeclaration` with `id` and `body`, a `TSModuleBlock` of the body's TypeScript; `from text` is an `Identifier` |

For example, `VibeCatchExpression > Literal.handler[value='']` selects a recovery to an empty string.

The other forms keep the TypeScript the checker reads: a block param is an arrow function argument; `do { ... }` and a throw expression are immediately invoked arrow functions; `error NotFound { id: string }` is a class with those fields; `service` and `control` are abstract classes; `schema User { ... }` is a `const User` typed by its fields; `fork`, `join`, and `await.all` are calls. A module declaration's body lints as its own TypeScript module: sharing a name with the file is not a redeclaration, and `no-undef` reports a file binding read from the body. The parser leaves the names it writes for the checker, such as a `match`'s temporaries, out of scope analysis, so no rule reports a name the author did not write. A Vite Plus integration and a VibeLang Oxlint configuration are not shipped.

## Debugging in editors

```vibe
// run: Console.log(tracedSample())
function tracedSample() {
  return withSpan(sample(), "sample")
}
// Output: sample
```

Add spans where an execution boundary should appear in telemetry. VibeLang functions are untraced by default; `tracing` can add spans to exported functions or named functions and methods that compile to frames. Anonymous functions get no automatic span. Effect's `DevTools` layer from `effect/devtools`, with its VS Code extension, shows fibers and logical span stacks across suspensions.

`vibelang` with `sourceMap` enabled, and the Vite plugin, map emitted JavaScript directly to `.vibe` positions. Debuggers that read standard source maps map breakpoints and paused frames to `.vibe`: VS Code's JavaScript debugger, Chrome and Edge DevTools, and JetBrains IDEs.

Compiled functions and producers keep their source names; clauses use the operation member's name, and region closures use names such as `sample$try`, `$catch`, `$finally`, and `$using`. The JavaScript stack shows the active frame above Effect's run loop. A paused continuation is a heap value: its frames are absent while a clause runs and active again when it resumes. Stepping over a pausing call can enter the run loop; set a breakpoint on the next source line. Use spans for the logical call chain. When reporting a problem, include the Effect version, inferred contract, and diagnostic.

## Coming from Effect

Library debugging concepts still apply; VibeLang's call execution, service declarations, and source mapping need language-aware tooling beyond the upstream TypeScript plugin.

## First calls from Effect TypeScript

| Code | Meaning and fix |
| --- | --- |
| EK1015 | Calls already run in VibeLang. Remove `yield*` from `const value = yield* load()`. Generators keep their own yield syntax. |
| EK4502 | A call already ran; its value has no `pipe` method. Write `f(s) \|> retry(%, policy)` or `retry(f(s), policy)`. |
| EK4503 | Read service values with `Users().region`. Extract an implementation method with `Users().find`; call it directly with `Users.find(id)`. |
| TS2540 | Object-type and interface members in `.vibe` are readonly by default. For a member you assign, declare `{ mutable n: number }`. Class fields and TypeScript declarations keep their own readonly rules. |
| EK2112 | Typed catch clauses are retired in statements and expressions. Write `catch (e) => match (e) { when NotFound: fallback; default: throw e; }`; `--fix` rewrites a handler whose annotation names error classes and keeps comments on rewritten return statements. |
| EK1001 | Parameter defaults are plain JavaScript. If an inferred default is an Effect where you need a value, make the parameter optional and compute `x ?? load()` in the body. An explicitly Effect-typed default can hold a program. |
| EK1016 | An unused, unexported `function main()` will never start. Write `export function main()`. This warning can be turned off for an intentional unused helper. |
| EK4409 | An `any` call can return an unrun program. A local constant whose initializer is known to be effectful is diagnosed even in a contracted function that compiles to plain code; give the callee its callable type. |
| EK4835 | The catchTag/catchTags fix omits the default arm when its handlers cover every failure in E. Partial handlers keep the rethrow. |
| TS2304 (`Model`, `Prompt`) | Two of effect's subpath packages have a module of this name, so neither is in scope (D310). The note names both imports; write the one you mean, such as `import { Model } from "effect/schema"`. |
