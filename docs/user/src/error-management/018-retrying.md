# Retrying

Retry transient domain failures when a new attempt has a useful chance of succeeding. A retry reruns the supplied program from the start, side effects included.

## Retrying failed computations

```vibe
// run: Console.log(loadWithRetries())
error Busy { attempt: number }

function loadWithRetries() {
  let attempts = 0
  return retry(() => {
    attempts += 1
    Console.log(`Attempt ${attempts}`)
    if (attempts < 3) throw new Busy({ attempt: attempts })
    return "Snapshot ready"
  }, { times: 3 })
}
```

```output
Attempt 1
Attempt 2
Attempt 3
Snapshot ready
```

The first attempt always runs; `{ times: 3 }` allows three more, at most four executions. State declared outside the retry callback, such as `attempts`, persists across attempts; locals inside it start fresh.

A failure ends the current attempt before the retry begins. Defects and interruption don't trigger a retry. Retried writes need an application policy that makes repeated execution safe.

## Selecting retryable domain errors

```vibe
// run: Console.log(Effect.flip(() => sendTransient()).transient)
error RequestRejected {
  transient: boolean
}

function sendRequest(): string!RequestRejected! {
  throw new RequestRejected({ transient: false })
}

function sendTransient() {
  return retry(() => sendRequest(), {
    times: 4,
    while: (error) => error.transient
  })
}
```

```output
false
```

`while` retries while its predicate holds; `until` stops once its predicate holds. Either can return a boolean or an Effect, so selection can consult a service. Unselected errors stay typed failures.

## Controlling timing and limits

```vibe
// run: Console.log(Effect.flip(() => sendWithBackoff())._tag); Console.log(Effect.flip(() => sendThreeMoreTimes())._tag)
function sendWithBackoff() {
  return retry(() => sendRequest(), {
    times: 4,
    while: (error) => error.transient,
    schedule: Schedule.exponential("150 millis")
  })
}

function sendThreeMoreTimes() {
  return retry(() => sendRequest(), Schedule.recurs(3))
}
```

```output
RequestRejected
RequestRejected
```

A schedule controls delay and can add its own stopping condition; with `times`, predicates, and a schedule combined, retrying stops when the applicable policy says to. `Schedule.recurs(3)` permits three retries. `Effect.repeat` repeats after success.

## Recovering after retries end

```vibe
// run: Console.log(sendOrQueue())
function sendOrQueue() {
  return Effect.retryOrElse(
    () => sendRequest(),
    Schedule.recurs(2),
    (error, retries) => {
      Console.log(`Queued after ${retries} retries; transient=${error.transient}`)
      return "Queued for later"
    }
  )
}
```

```output
Queued after 2 retries; transient=false
Queued for later
```

`retryOrElse` runs recovery once its schedule is exhausted, passing the last error and the schedule's output (a retry count for `Schedule.recurs`). Recovery can add its own errors and requirements.

## Coming from Effect

`retry(() => sendRequest(), policy)` and `Effect.retry(() => sendRequest(), policy)` both pass the request as a program, so each attempt reruns the call. Passing the call itself, `retry(sendRequest(), policy)`, still compiles but is being retired. When an attempt needs several statements, use a callback or block.
