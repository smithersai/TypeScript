# Fallback

A fallback runs another computation after an expected failure; a catch expression or callback keeps it lazy.

## Recovering with another computation

```vibe
// run: Console.log(title())
error SourceOffline

function latestTitle(): string!SourceOffline! {
  throw new SourceOffline()
}

function cachedTitle() {
  Console.log("Reading saved title")
  return "Saved issue"
}

function title() {
  try {
    return latestTitle()
  } catch (error) {
    return cachedTitle()
  }
}
// string!!
```

```output
Reading saved title
Saved issue
```

The cache is read only if the primary computation fails. The fallback's errors become `title`'s; handling the primary doesn't handle them. Ordinary catch propagates defects and interruption. A typed failure beside a defect propagates as a defect, and one beside an interruption is handled.

```vibe
// run: Console.log(titleInline())
function titleInline() {
  return latestTitle() catch cachedTitle()
}
// string!!
```

```output
Reading saved title
Saved issue
```

`x catch fallback` is the expression form and recovers exactly what the statement does: the left side runs inside the catch, and the fallback runs only after an expected failure. `catch` binds looser than `??` and `||` and tighter than `? :`, so `a ?? b catch c` applies the default inside the catch.

`Effect.catch(() => latestTitle(), () => cachedTitle())` also works, with the same rule as source catch: it leaves a cause with a defect alone and recovers an expected failure beside an interruption, dropping the interruption. When interruption must propagate intact, match on `exit(...)`. `Effect.catchTag`, `Effect.catchIf`, and `Effect.catchFilter` also select domain failures, under Effect's own recovery policy.

## Supplying a default success

```vibe
// run: Console.log(titleOrPlaceholder())
function titleOrPlaceholder() {
  return latestTitle() catch "No title available"
}
// string!!
```

```output
No title available
```

`x catch value` is `Effect.orElseSucceed(x, () => value)`: the value is computed only after an expected failure, and every expected error of `x` is discarded. To keep some visible, take the failure and rethrow the rest: `latestTitle() catch (error) => match (error) { when SourceOffline: "No title available"; default: throw error; }`. The fallback is VibeLang code, so it can call functions that fail or need services; their errors become the expression's. `Effect.orElseSucceed(latestTitle(), () => "No title available")` still works, with a synchronous callback.

## Typing both sides

```vibe
// run: Console.log(JSON.stringify(lookup()))
type Lookup = { _tag: "Found"; title: string } | { _tag: "Offline" }

function lookup(): Lookup!! {
  return { _tag: "Found", title: latestTitle() } catch { _tag: "Offline" }
}
```

```output
{"_tag":"Offline"}
```

Both sides of a catch expression take the expression's contextual type, as both branches of a conditional do. Here that is `Lookup`, so each `_tag` stays a literal and the result checks as a `Lookup`. Without a contextual type, each side keeps its own type and the value is their union.

## Trying alternatives until one succeeds

```vibe
// run: Console.log(bestTitle())
function bestTitle() {
  return Effect.firstSuccessOf([
    () => latestTitle(),
    () => cachedTitle(),
    () => "Untitled issue"
  ])
}
```

```output
Reading saved title
Saved issue
```

`firstSuccessOf` tries programs one at a time in priority order and stops on success; if all fail with expected errors, it reports the last error. A cause without an expected failure stops the search, and so does one with a defect; an expected failure beside an interruption activates the next alternative. An empty iterable is a defect: pass at least one.

A chain of catch expressions also tries alternatives in order, because `catch` associates to the left: `latestTitle() catch cachedTitle() catch "Untitled issue"` tries the cache after the primary fails and the title after the cache fails. Unlike `firstSuccessOf`, it stops at a mixed cause, as every source catch does.

## Coming from Effect

Pass each alternative as a program, `Effect.firstSuccessOf([() => latestTitle(), () => cachedTitle()])`, so each call runs only when its alternative is tried. A call runs where it appears.
