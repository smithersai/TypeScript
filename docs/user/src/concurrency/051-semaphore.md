# Semaphore

A semaphore limits access to a shared resource with a pool of permits. One permit gives mutual exclusion; a larger pool lets several operations enter at once. When too few permits remain, callers wait without blocking the JavaScript thread.

## Creating a permit pool

```vibe
// run: const limit = makeUploadLimit(); Console.log(Semaphore.withPermits(limit, 3, () => "three permits acquired"))
function makeUploadLimit() {
  return Semaphore.make(3)
}
// Semaphore.Semaphore!!
// Output: three permits acquired
```

Create the pool once for the callers that share a limit: a pool allocated inside every upload gives each upload its own permits and no combined limit. A permit represents access, not a resource value such as a connection.

## Limiting concurrent access

```vibe
// run: Console.log(JSON.stringify(uploadAll()))
function uploadAll() {
  const uploads = Semaphore.make(2)
  return forEach(["a.csv", "b.csv", "c.csv", "d.csv"], (file) => {
    return Semaphore.withPermits(uploads, 1) {
      Console.log("upload started", file)
      sleep("30 millis")
      return file
    }
  }, { concurrency: "unbounded" })
}
// Output: upload started a.csv
// Output: upload started b.csv
// Output: upload started c.csv
// Output: upload started d.csv
// Output: ["a.csv","b.csv","c.csv","d.csv"]
```

The traversal can start all four callers, but only two enter the permit-protected region at once. Use this when unrelated parts of the application share a resource limit; a traversal's own `concurrency` option limits only that traversal.

## Acquiring several permits around work

```vibe
// run: Console.log(JSON.stringify(weightedJobs()))
function weightedJobs() {
  const memoryBudget = Semaphore.make(4)
  return forEach([1, 2, 3], (weight) => {
    return Semaphore.withPermits(memoryBudget, weight) {
      sleep("20 millis")
      return `job using ${weight} units`
    }
  }, { concurrency: 3 })
}
// Output: ["job using 1 units","job using 2 units","job using 3 units"]
```

An operation waits until it can acquire all its requested permits together, which models jobs with different resource costs, such as memory reservations. A request for more permits than the pool can supply leaves the operation waiting, so keep job weights within the configured pool.

## Releasing permits safely

```vibe
// run: Console.log(releaseOnFailure())
error Rejected

function releaseOnFailure() {
  const mutex = Semaphore.make(1)
  try {
    Semaphore.withPermits(mutex, 1) { throw new Rejected() }
  } catch (error) {
    Console.log("first job rejected", error._tag)
  }
  return do {
    const $pipe0: (string)!! = () => "next job can enter"
    const $pipe1 = mutex
    Semaphore.withPermits($pipe1, 1, $pipe0)
  }
}
// Output: first job rejected Rejected
// Output: next job can enter
```

`withPermits` returns acquired permits on success, failure, and interruption. Prefer it to pairing `Semaphore.take` and `release` by hand, where cancellation between acquisition and cleanup registration can leak permits. `Semaphore.withPermit` is the single-permit form, with the same release guarantee.
