# Fibers

A fiber is a running computation with a result and a lifetime. Effect's lightweight fibers overlap waiting work, inspect completion, and cancel safely. They give concurrency on the runtime's scheduler, not parallel CPU execution of JavaScript.

## Forking and awaiting

```vibe
// run: Console.log(buildDashboard())
function buildDashboard() {
  const chart = fork {
    sleep("30 millis")
    return "chart"
  }
  Console.log("preparing dashboard frame")
  return join chart
}
// string!!
// Output: preparing dashboard frame
// Output: chart
```

`fork` starts a child fiber and returns its handle, here a `Fiber<string>`, without waiting for its result: unlike an ordinary call, the parent continues while the child waits. `join` waits for the child and returns its value or propagates its failure.

`fork loadChart()`, or the call form `fork(loadChart())`, forks one call; `fork { ... }` forks a block. `join` takes a fiber, not a call: a call already runs and waits where it stands. `await` means only the await operations below; `await chart` is EK4609, whose quick fix writes `join chart`.

## Awaiting completion as data

```vibe
// run: Console.log(inspectChild().isFailure())
function inspectChild() {
  const child = fork { throw "render failed" }
  const exit = Fiber.await(child)
  if (exit.isFailure()) {
    Console.log("renderer stopped", Cause.squash(exit.cause))
  }
  return exit
}
// Output: renderer stopped render failed
// Output: true
```

`Fiber.await` succeeds with an `Exit`, which also represents defects and interruption, so it doesn't rethrow the child's failure into the caller. Use `join child` to propagate failure and `Fiber.await(child)` when the caller decides what the outcome means.

## Handling asynchronous interruption

```vibe
// run: stopWorker()
function stopWorker() {
  const worker = fork {
    try {
      sleep("1 minute")
    } finally {
      Console.log("worker finalizer")
    }
  }
  sleep("10 millis")
  worker.interrupt()
  Console.log("worker has terminated")
}
// Output: worker finalizer
// Output: worker has terminated
```

Cancellation needs no hand-written polling loop: Effect delivers it at runtime boundaries, defers it in uninterruptible regions, and runs cleanup before `interrupt` returns. A long plain JavaScript calculation still holds the host thread until it returns or reaches an Effect operation.

To continue during cleanup, fork the interruption (`fork worker.interrupt()`) and join that fiber before its owner exits. When cleanup ordering matters, avoid immediate unsafe runtime methods.

## Protecting work from interruption

```vibe
// run: saveReport(); pollStatus(false); const stopped = Effect.exit(() => pollStatus(true)); Console.log(stopped.isFailure() && Cause.hasInterrupts(stopped.cause))
function saveReport() {
  uninterruptible {
    Console.log("saving; an interruption waits until the block ends")
    restore {
      sleep("1 second")
    }
    Console.log("saved")
  }
}

function pollStatus(cancelled: boolean) {
  interruptible {
    sleep("1 second")
  }
  if (cancelled) interrupt()
}
// Output: saving; an interruption waits until the block ends
// Output: saved
// Output: true
```

- `uninterruptible` (`Effect.uninterruptibleMask`) runs its block without interruption: an interruption that arrives waits until the block ends.
- `restore` inside it brings back the fiber's previous interruptibility, so long waits stay cancellable.
- `interruptible` (`Effect.interruptible`) makes its code interruptible even inside an uninterruptible region.
- `interrupt()` (`Effect.interrupt`) interrupts the running fiber.

Statements in these blocks stay code of the enclosing function, so `return` returns from it. The blocks call prelude functions of the same names; `uninterruptible(saveRows())` passes a program instead.

## Combining results

```vibe
// run: Console.log(combine())
function title() {
  return "Inventory"
}

function rowCount() {
  sleep("20 millis")
  return 18
}

function combine() {
  const [name, count] = await.all [title(), rowCount()]
  return `${name}: ${count}`
}
// string!!
// Output: Inventory: 18
```

`await.all [...]`, like `Promise.all`, starts every element in its own fiber, waits for all, and keeps the array or object shape. An await operation's element is a program because of where it stands, so `rowCount()` starts in its fiber, not before the operation. If one fails, `await.all` interrupts the rest and propagates the failure, as `all` fails fast. For an expected-failure fallback, wrap it in `try` and recover in `catch`; defects and interruption still propagate.

`await.allSettled [...]` returns each success or typed failure as a `Result` and never fails with a typed error. Defects and interruption propagate exactly as in `Effect.all` with `mode: "result"`, and so does a typed failure beside a defect, as a defect; a cause with no typed failure still propagates. Wrap each program in `Effect.exit` to keep every outcome as data, mixed causes included.

For fibers you already hold, use `join`: `const [name, count] = join [titleFiber, rowsFiber]`. An await operation also accepts a fiber or a `Deferred` as an element and waits for it without restarting it.

## Racing events

```vibe
// run: provide TestClock.layer() { const jobs = Queue.unbounded<string>(); const shutdown = Deferred.make<void>(); jobs.offer("build"); Console.log(nextEvent(jobs, shutdown)); shutdown.succeed(undefined); Console.log(nextEvent(jobs, shutdown)); const idle = fork nextEvent(jobs, Deferred.make<void>()); TestClock.adjust("30 seconds"); Console.log(join idle) }
function nextEvent(jobs: Queue.Queue<string>, shutdown: Deferred.Deferred<void>) {
  return await.race [
    `job: ${Queue.take(jobs)}`,
    do {
      Deferred.await(shutdown)
      "shutdown"
    },
    do {
      sleep("30 seconds")
      "idle"
    }
  ]
}
// string!!
// Output: job: build
// Output: shutdown
// Output: idle
```

`await.race [...]` (`Promise.race`, `Effect.raceFirst`) starts each element in its own fiber, returns the first to finish, success or failure, and interrupts the rest; of elements ready at once, the first written wins. A `do { ... }` element runs its own statements, and its last expression is the element's value. `await.any [...]` (`Effect.raceAll`) returns the first success instead and fails only when every element fails. To poll without waiting, test `Queue.poll(jobs)` with an `if`.

## Running a loop body concurrently

```vibe
// run: printAll(["a", "", "b"])
function fetchPage(id: string) {
  sleep("5 millis")
  return `page ${id}`
}

function printAll(ids: ReadonlyArray<string>) {
  for concurrent(8) (const id of ids) {
    if (id === "") continue
    Console.log(fetchPage(id))
  }
}
// Output: page a
// Output: page b
```

`for concurrent` runs its body for each item in its own fiber and ends when all finish; `for concurrent(8)` runs at most eight at once, and `for concurrent (...)` sets no limit. A failure interrupts the items still running and fails the loop. `continue` ends one item. Because each item has its own fiber, a `break` that would leave the loop (EK4605) and a `return` (EK4606) are errors; throw to stop every item. For results, use `forEach`.

## Supervising child lifetimes

```vibe
// run: request()
function request() {
  try {
    const progress = fork {
      try {
        sleep("1 minute")
      } finally {
        Console.log("progress reporter stopped")
      }
    }
    sleep("20 millis") // the try block owns progress, even without a join
  } finally {
    Console.log("request finishing")
  }
}
// Output: progress reporter stopped
// Output: request finishing
```

`fork` belongs to the innermost region the source names around it: a function body, an arrow function's expression body included, one iteration of a loop, a `try`, `catch`, or `finally` block, a block that declares `using`, or a `provide` or mask block. Leaving the region interrupts unfinished children and waits for their cleanup. Braces alone own nothing, so a `fork` in an `if` branch or a bare block lives until the function body exits, with or without the braces. For ownership by the parent fiber instead, use `Effect.forkChild`.

Forked fibers inherit the current services and tracing context. Control-operation handlers belong to one fiber, so handle those operations inside each child that performs them.

## Selecting scoped or detached lifetimes

```vibe
// run: const scope = Scope.make(); const background = inCallerScope(scope); Scope.close(scope, Exit.succeed(undefined)); const stopped = Fiber.await(background); Console.log(stopped.isFailure() && Cause.hasInterrupts(stopped.cause)); detachedExample(); Console.log("detached finished")
function inCallerScope(scope: Scope) {
  const background = forkIn(scope, sleep("1 minute"))
  sleep("20 millis")
  // Closing scope interrupts background.
  return background
}

function detachedExample() {
  const independent = detach(sleep("50 millis"))
  join independent
}
// Output: true
// Output: detached finished
```

`forkIn(scope, program)` attaches the child to a scope you hold; it lives until that scope closes. `detach(program)` ties the child to nothing: it survives its parent and needs an explicit shutdown strategy (the example joins it to stay bounded). `Effect.forkScoped` attaches the child to the caller's scope and leaves `Scope` in the caller's requirements until a scope is supplied.

A fiber that a region's `fork` started is interrupted when the region exits, so its value may go only where the region keeps it: a `const` or `let` declared in the region, `join`, the prelude's `interrupt`, a `Fiber` function whose result holds no fiber, such as `Fiber.interrupt(f)`, `Fiber.await(f)`, or the method `f.interrupt()`, and the operand of a `fork`, an element of an await operation, or the body of a `for concurrent` loop in the same region. Returning it, alone or in an object or array, assigning it to a binding or property declared outside the region, storing it in a collection, passing it to any other call, or capturing it in a function or block param is EK4838, an error no setting lowers; `() => fork work()` returns its fiber from the arrow's body, so it is EK4838 too. Start a fiber that must outlive its region with `Effect.forkScoped(() => work())` for the caller's scope, `forkIn(scope, () => work())` for a scope the caller holds, or `detach(() => work())` and a shutdown strategy. To bound a `join`, race it in the region: `await.race [join f, do { sleep("5 seconds"); throw new Late() }]`.

## Understanding execution scheduling

```vibe
// run: waitForReady()
function waitForReady() {
  const ready = Deferred.make<void>()
  const worker = fork {
    Console.log("worker initialized")
    ready.succeed(undefined)
    sleep("20 millis")
  }
  ready.await()
  Console.log("initialization is complete")
  join worker
}
// Output: worker initialized
// Output: initialization is complete
```

Forking schedules a child; it doesn't prove the child reached a particular statement. `yieldNow()` lets other work run but guarantees no readiness, and sleeping for an estimated startup time leaves a race. When ordering matters, use a `Deferred`: `ready.await()` waits until the child completes it.
