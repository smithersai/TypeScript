# Scope

A scope owns registered finalizers and runs them when its lifetime ends. Use `using` for lexical ownership, or an explicit scope when several operations must share a lifetime independent of one function call.

[Upstream page](https://effect.website/docs/v4/resource-management/scope)

## Registering finalizers

```vibe
// run: Console.log(runRegisteredWork())
function registeredWork() {
  Effect.addFinalizer((exit) => {
    Console.log(`Work scope closed with ${exit._tag}`)
  })
  return "Prepared"
}
// string!!Scope

function runRegisteredWork() {
  return Effect.scoped(() => registeredWork())
}
// string!!
// Output: Work scope closed with Success
// Output: Prepared
```

`Effect.addFinalizer` attaches cleanup to the current scope, not the function's return. `Scope` is in the prelude: it names the module, and in a contract it means `Scope.Scope`, so no import is needed. `Effect.scoped` creates a scope, runs the program, and closes the scope with its outcome: the finalizer receives a success exit on success, and a failure exit on typed failure, a defect, or interruption.

Finalizers run in reverse registration order by default, with interruption deferred during release. Their typed error channel must be `never`, so handle expected cleanup failures inside the callback. A defect during release stays in the resulting cause, and an expected failure beside it becomes a defect.

## Opening and closing scopes explicitly

```vibe
// run: Console.log(manuallyManagedWork())
function manuallyManagedWork() {
  return Effect.acquireUseRelease(
    () => Scope.make(),
    (scope) => {
      Scope.addFinalizer(scope, () => Console.log("First finalizer"))
      Scope.addFinalizer(scope, () => Console.log("Second finalizer"))
      return Scope.provide(() => registeredWork(), scope)
    },
    (scope, exit) => Scope.close(scope, exit)
  )
}
// Output: Work scope closed with Success
// Output: Second finalizer
// Output: First finalizer
// Output: Prepared
```

`Scope.make` creates a closeable scope; `Scope.close` supplies the exit its finalizers observe. The bracket closes the scope even if work fails or is cancelled, passing the actual outcome to release. The finalizer from `registeredWork` runs first, then the explicit ones in reverse.

`Scope.provide(program, scope)` supplies a scope without closing it when the program returns. Closing a scope doesn't cancel computations that merely use it; use scoped fiber ownership for cancellation. A finalizer registered in a closed scope runs immediately, so a closed scope can't extend a resource's lifetime.

## Acquiring resources with automatic release

```vibe
// run: Console.log(copyLabels())
function openBuffer(label: string) {
  return Effect.acquireRelease(
    () => {
      Console.log(`Opened ${label}`)
      return { label }
    },
    (buffer) => Console.log(`Closed ${buffer.label}`)
  )
}
// { label: string }!!Scope

function copyLabels() {
  using source = openBuffer("source")
  using destination = openBuffer("destination")
  return `${source.label} -> ${destination.label}`
}
// string!!
// Output: Opened source
// Output: Opened destination
// Output: Closed destination
// Output: Closed source
// Output: source -> destination
```

`acquireRelease` makes acquisition uninterruptible by default and registers release before exposing the resource. Its third argument `{ interruptible: true }` permits cancellation during acquisition, and `using` keeps that choice. A successful acquisition gets exactly one release when its scope closes; a failed one registers none.

`using` gives each declared acquisition a lifetime ending with the enclosing block. Don't return a resource to use after the block closes; return derived data, or let the caller own the acquisition. `using` works the same with Effect's existing scoped APIs.

## Releasing JavaScript Disposables

`using` releases each resource exactly once, on success, typed failure, defect, or interruption, including an interruption that is pending when the initializer gives its value: receiving the value and registering its release can't be separated. A value acquired with `Effect.acquireRelease` or `Effect.acquireDisposable` is released only by its release, so a JavaScript Disposable that `acquireRelease` returns and its release disposes is closed once. Any other value with a disposal method is disposed once at block exit, `[Symbol.asyncDispose]` first, so `using` also accepts an AsyncDisposable; `using` reads that method once, when it acquires the value. A value with neither method is TS2850, unless its initializer requires `Scope`.

Cancellation follows Effect. `using` adds no mask: every initializer runs with the interruptibility in force where the `using` stands, as `yield*` runs it, whatever its type. A `timeout` around `using db = openDb()` cuts a wait in `openDb`, and `using` registers nothing. An acquisition inside the initializer keeps its own policy: `acquireRelease` and `acquireDisposable` protect acquisition unless you pass `{ interruptible: true }`, so `using db = Effect.acquireDisposable(() => openDb())` waits `openDb` out and releases its value once. An interruption that arrives inside a mask of the initializer's own, such as `Effect.uninterruptible(() => open())`, is delivered as that mask ends, before `using` receives the value, so register such a value inside the mask with `acquireDisposable`.

This example checks success, typed failure, defect, and interruption requested
while acquisition is waiting. Each path closes the handle exactly once:

```vibe
// run: Console.log(JSON.stringify({ succeeds: run("succeed"), fails: run("fail"), dies: run("die"), pending: pending() }))
module files {
  // Plain TypeScript inside this module, not VibeLang.
  export function open(events: string[]) {
    let closed = false
    events.push("open")
    return {
      [Symbol.dispose](): void {
        if (closed) throw new Error("closed twice")
        closed = true
        events.push("closed")
      }
    }
  }
}
import { open } from files

error Bad {}

function acquire(events: string[]) {
  return Effect.acquireRelease(
    // sync's first argument is plain TypeScript, not VibeLang.
    () => sync((log: string[]) => open(log), events),
    // sync's first argument is plain TypeScript, not VibeLang.
    (file) => sync((f) => f[Symbol.dispose](), file)
  )
}

function describe(outcome: Exit.Exit<void, Bad>) {
  if (Exit.isSuccess(outcome)) return "success"
  if (Exit.hasDies(outcome)) return "defect"
  if (Exit.hasFails(outcome)) return "failure"
  return Exit.hasInterrupts(outcome) ? "interrupted" : "other"
}

function run(ending: string) {
  const events: string[] = []
  const outcome = exit(() => {
    using file = acquire(events)
    events.push("body")
    if (ending === "fail") throw new Bad()
    if (ending === "die") Effect.die("boom")
  })
  return [describe(outcome), events]
}

function pending() {
  const events: string[] = []
  const entered = Deferred.make<void>()
  const gate = Deferred.make<void>()
  function work() {
    using file = Effect.acquireRelease(
      () => {
        Deferred.succeed(entered, undefined)
        Deferred.await(gate)
        // sync's first argument is plain TypeScript, not VibeLang.
        return sync((log: string[]) => open(log), events)
      },
      // sync's first argument is plain TypeScript, not VibeLang.
      (file) => sync((f) => f[Symbol.dispose](), file)
    )
    events.push("never runs")
  }
  const child = Effect.forkChild(() => work())
  Deferred.await(entered)
  child.interruptUnsafe(98765)
  Deferred.succeed(gate, undefined)
  const outcome = Fiber.await(child)
  return [describe(outcome), events]
}
// Output: {"succeeds":["success",["open","body","closed"]],"fails":["failure",["open","body","closed"]],"dies":["defect",["open","body","closed"]],"pending":["interrupted",["open","closed"]]}
```

## Arranging nested resource lifetimes

```vibe
// run: nestedLifetimes(); observeOwnership()
function nestedLifetimes() {
  using outer = openBuffer("session");
  {
    using inner = openBuffer("request")
    Console.log(`${outer.label}/${inner.label}`)
  }
  Console.log("Request buffer closed; session still open")
}

function mixedOwnership() {
  const callerOwned = openBuffer("caller")
  using local = openBuffer("local")
  Console.log(`${callerOwned.label}/${local.label}`)
}
// void!!Scope

function observeOwnership() {
  Effect.scoped {
    mixedOwnership()
    Console.log("Local closed; caller buffer still open")
  }
}
// Output: Opened session
// Output: Opened request
// Output: session/request
// Output: Closed request
// Output: Request buffer closed; session still open
// Output: Closed session
// Output: Opened caller
// Output: Opened local
// Output: caller/local
// Output: Closed local
// Output: Local closed; caller buffer still open
// Output: Closed caller
```

The inner `using` resource closes before the outer block continues. In `mixedOwnership`, the acquisition without `using` belongs to the caller's scope though the function also owns a local resource, so the caller's buffer closes only when `Effect.scoped` exits.

Operations that only register finalizers in one scope share its lifetime. Use separate `Effect.scoped` calls when one operation's resources must close before the next begins, and one outer scope when later operations depend on earlier resources.

A region that calls `fork` also owns a scope, even without `using`: a function body, one loop iteration, a `try`, `catch`, or `finally` block, a block that declares `using`, or a `provide` or mask block. Its child is interrupted when the region exits, and the region waits for cleanup; an `if` branch or a bare block owns nothing. `Effect.forkScoped` uses the caller's scope instead and adds `Scope` to `R`; `Effect.forkDetach` gives a detached lifetime.

## Sequencing scoped operations with rollback

```vibe
// run: provide ProjectSteps = { create: (stage) => { Console.log(`create ${stage}`); return stage }, remove: (id) => Console.log(`remove ${id}`), finish: () => "ready" } { Console.log(setupProject()) }; provide ProjectSteps = { create: (stage) => { Console.log(`create ${stage}`); if (stage === "index") throw new SetupFailed({ stage }); return stage }, remove: (id) => Console.log(`remove ${id}`), finish: () => "ready" } { try { setupProject() } catch (error) { Console.log(error.stage) } }
error SetupFailed {
  stage: string
}

service ProjectSteps {
  create(stage: string): string!SetupFailed
  remove(id: string): void!!
  finish(storage: string, index: string): string!SetupFailed
}

function reserveStep(stage: string) {
  const steps = ProjectSteps()
  return Effect.acquireRelease(
    () => steps.create(stage),
    (id, exit) => {
      if (exit.isFailure()) steps.remove(id)
    }
  )
}
// string!SetupFailed!ProjectSteps | Scope

function setupProject() {
  return Effect.scoped {
    const storage = reserveStep("storage")
    const index = reserveStep("index")
    return ProjectSteps.finish(storage, index)
  }
}
// string!SetupFailed!ProjectSteps
// Output: create storage
// Output: create index
// Output: ready
// Output: create storage
// Output: create index
// Output: remove storage
// Output: index
```

Neither reservation uses lexical `using`, so both register in the same scope. A successful exit keeps the created artifacts. If index creation fails, storage is removed; if `finish` fails, index is removed before storage.

The finalizers see the whole setup's exit, so defects and interruption trigger the same rollback. Nested `using` blocks would end those lifetimes earlier and withhold the overall outcome from the finalizers. This compensates for successful steps; it is not an atomic transaction with an external system.

```vibe
// run: const result = exerciseRollback(); Console.log(JSON.stringify({ outcome: result.outcome._tag, removed: result.removed }))
function exerciseRollback() {
  const removed: string[] = []
  const testLayer = Layer.succeed(ProjectSteps, {
    create(stage) { return stage },
    remove(id) { removed.push(id) },
    finish(_storage, _index) { throw new SetupFailed({ stage: "finish" }) }
  })
  const outcome = Effect.result(() => Effect.provide(() => setupProject(), testLayer))
  return { outcome, removed } // removed: ["index", "storage"]
}
// Output: {"outcome":"Failure","removed":["index","storage"]}
```

Test failure at each stage to confirm which steps were acquired and which compensations ran. If compensation can fail, handle its expected failure in the release callback and keep unrecoverable cleanup failures as defects; never discard them to make rollback look successful.

## Coming from Effect

Use `using` for a resource that belongs to its block, and `Effect.scoped`, `Effect.addFinalizer`, and the `Scope` module for shared or manually controlled lifetimes; calls run them directly, without generator syntax.
