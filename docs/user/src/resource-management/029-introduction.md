# Introduction

Resources need cleanup on success, failure, and cancellation. Use `finally` for unconditional cleanup, `using` for lexical resource ownership, and Effect's outcome-aware combinators when release depends on how work ended.

## Guaranteeing cleanup

```vibe
// run: Console.log(exportRows(true)); try { exportRows(false) } catch (error) { Console.log(error._tag) }
error ExportRejected

function exportRows(accepted: boolean) {
  try {
    Console.log("Export started")
    if (!accepted) throw new ExportRejected()
    return "Export complete"
  } finally {
    Console.log("Export finished")
  }
}
// string!ExportRejected!
// Output: Export started
// Output: Export finished
// Output: Export complete
// Output: Export started
// Output: Export finished
// Output: ExportRejected
```

`finally` runs after success, a typed failure, a defect, interruption, an early return, or a handler abandoning the protected computation. It has Effect cleanup semantics, including deferred interruption while cleanup runs.

`Effect.ensuring(() => work(), () => cleanup())` remains for a reusable combinator; `finally` is usually clearer for local cleanup. A cleanup failure is kept with the original outcome, even when a handler abandons the computation while interruption is pending; it never silently replaces an earlier failure. When either is a defect, the expected failure becomes a defect of the same error.

`ensuring` requires cleanup whose typed error channel is `never`; source `finally` permits typed cleanup failures and uses `Effect.onExit` semantics.

## Finalizing based on the outcome

```vibe
// run: Console.log(observedExport(true)); try { observedExport(false) } catch (error) { Console.log(error._tag) }
function observedExport(accepted: boolean) {
  try {
    return exportRows(accepted)
  } finally (exit) {
    if (exit.isSuccess()) {
      Console.log("Export succeeded")
    } else {
      Console.log("Export stopped", JSON.stringify(exit.cause.reasons.map((reason) => reason._tag)))
    }
  }
}
// Output: Export started
// Output: Export finished
// Output: Export succeeded
// Output: Export complete
// Output: Export started
// Output: Export finished
// Output: Export stopped ["Fail"]
// Output: ExportRejected
```

`finally (exit)` binds the try statement's `Exit`, as `Effect.onExit` does. A success carries no value, since the try block's statements have none; a failure carries the complete cause, so unlike a boolean success flag it keeps defects and cancellation as well as domain errors. The cleanup runs uninterruptibly, and successful cleanup preserves the original result.

## Cleaning up failed work

```vibe
// run: Console.log(reportFailedExport(true)); try { reportFailedExport(false) } catch (error) { Console.log(error._tag) }
function reportFailedExport(accepted: boolean) {
  return Effect.onError(() => exportRows(accepted), (cause) => {
    if (cause.hasInterrupts()) {
      Console.log("Export cancelled; cleanup complete")
    } else {
      Console.log("Export failed; cleanup complete")
    }
  })
}
// Output: Export started
// Output: Export finished
// Output: Export complete
// Output: Export started
// Output: Export finished
// Output: Export failed; cleanup complete
// Output: ExportRejected
```

`onError` runs only on an unsuccessful outcome, defects and interruption included. Its callback receives the full cause and runs as cleanup; it doesn't recover the computation. Ordinary catch, by contrast, handles expected failures and skips causes containing defects or interruption.

## Bracketing acquisition, use, and release

```vibe
// run: provide LeaseStore = { acquire: () => ({ id: "test-lease" }), release: (lease) => Console.log(`Released ${lease.id}`) } { Console.log(withLease()) }
interface Lease {
  id: string
}

service LeaseStore {
  acquire(): Lease!!
  release(lease: Lease): void!!
}

function withLease() {
  const store = LeaseStore()
  return Effect.acquireUseRelease(
    () => store.acquire(),
    (lease) => {
      Console.log(`Working with lease ${lease.id}`)
      return lease.id
    },
    (lease, exit) => {
      Console.log(`Releasing after ${exit._tag}`)
      store.release(lease)
    }
  )
}
// string!!LeaseStore
// Output: Working with lease test-lease
// Output: Releasing after Success
// Output: Released test-lease
// Output: test-lease
```

`acquireUseRelease` protects acquisition and release and allows normal interruption during use. After a successful acquisition, release runs exactly once, even when use fails or is cancelled. After a failed acquisition it never runs, so a failing acquisition must first clean up its own partial work.

Release receives the resource and the use phase's `Exit`. The combined contract includes the failures and requirements of acquisition, use, and release. Protected acquisition, the default, can delay cancellation, so acquisition should finish in bounded time.

## Giving the caller resource ownership

```vibe
// run: Console.log(example()); provide LeaseStore = { acquire: () => ({ id: "owned" }), release: (lease) => Console.log(`Released ${lease.id}`) } { Console.log(leaseId()) }
function acquireLease() {
  const store = LeaseStore()
  return Effect.acquireRelease(
    () => store.acquire(),
    (lease) => store.release(lease)
  )
}
// Lease!!LeaseStore | Scope

function leaseId() {
  using lease = acquireLease()
  return lease.id
}
// string!!LeaseStore

const LeaseStoreTest = Layer.succeed(LeaseStore, {
  acquire() { return ({ id: "test-lease" }) },
  release(_lease) {}
})

function example() {
  provide LeaseStoreTest { return leaseId() }
}
// Output: test-lease
// Output: Released owned
// Output: owned
```

`acquireRelease` registers a release in a scope and returns the acquired value. `using` gives that acquisition a lexical scope, releases it at block exit, and removes `Scope` from the caller's requirements. The release callback must have no typed failure: handle an expected release error, or promote it on purpose with `Effect.orDie`.

Only `using` acquisitions belong to the lexical block. An acquisition without `using` keeps `Scope` in `R` and belongs to the caller, even when the same function also uses a local resource.

`Scope` is in the prelude, as the module and as the type alias for `Scope.Scope`, so these contracts need no import. `using` adds no masking policy: `acquireRelease` masks acquisition by default, and its third argument `{ interruptible: true }` lets cancellation reach an acquisition that waits on the outside world. An adapter that receives a resource after cancellation must release it; the spec's resource adapter detects that race with the runtime's TypeScript `suspend` helper.

`using` releases a JavaScript Disposable or AsyncDisposable exactly once, even when an interruption is pending as acquisition ends, and a value acquired with `Effect.acquireRelease` is released only by its release ([Releasing JavaScript Disposables](030-scope.md#releasing-javascript-disposables)).

## Coming from Effect

`try`/`finally` replaces local `ensuring` chains; `using resource = acquire()` replaces a scoped acquisition for a lexical block. Effect's `onExit`, `onError`, and bracket combinators still take programs and VibeLang callbacks.
