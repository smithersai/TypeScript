# Tracking Fibers

`FiberSet` and `FiberMap` track groups of running fibers and clean them up with an owning scope. Use a set for an unkeyed group and a map when each operation has an identity, such as a client ID.

## Managing groups of running fibers

```vibe
// run: Console.log(JSON.stringify(runGroup()))
function runGroup() {
  using workers = FiberSet.make<number>()
  const first = FiberSet.run(workers) {
    sleep("30 millis")
    return 1
  }
  const second = FiberSet.run(workers) {
    sleep("50 millis")
    return 2
  }
  Console.log("tracked workers", FiberSet.size(workers))
  return [first.join(), second.join()]
}
```

```output
tracked workers 2
[1,2]
```

`FiberSet.run` forks a program and registers its fiber; `FiberSet.add` registers an existing fiber; `size` counts the fibers tracked now. Join individual handles to collect results; tracking produces no ordered result list.

## Tracking fibers by key

```vibe
// run: Console.log(replacePreview())
function replacePreview() {
  using previews = FiberMap.make<string, string>()
  FiberMap.run(previews, "editor-1") {
    sleep("1 second")
    return "old preview"
  }
  const current = FiberMap.run(previews, "editor-1") {
    sleep("20 millis")
    return "new preview"
  }
  return current.join()
}
```

```output
new preview
```

Running a fiber under an existing key interrupts that key's previous fiber: latest-request behavior, with no obsolete handle kept elsewhere. `FiberMap.has` and `get` inspect tracked keys, `remove` interrupts and removes a keyed fiber, and `run` with `onlyIfMissing: true` keeps existing work instead of replacing it.

## Removing completed work

```vibe
// run: Console.log(waitForAllTracked())
function waitForAllTracked() {
  using workers = FiberSet.make<void>()
  FiberSet.run(workers, () => sleep("10 millis"))
  FiberSet.run(workers, () => sleep("20 millis"))
  FiberSet.awaitEmpty(workers)
  return FiberSet.size(workers) // 0
}
```

```output
0
```

Sets and maps remove completed fibers automatically, so a long-lived owner doesn't accumulate finished handles; a map also keeps an older completion from deleting a newer fiber under the same key. `awaitEmpty` waits for the current group to drain. `FiberSet.join` instead waits on the set's failure signal and propagates a tracked failure; it is not a successful drain.

## Interrupting tracked work on scope closure

```vibe
// run: serveBriefly()
function serveBriefly() {
  {
    using workers = FiberSet.make<void>()
    FiberSet.run(workers) {
      try {
        sleep("1 minute")
      } finally {
        Console.log("tracked worker cleaned up")
      }
    }
    sleep("20 millis")
  }
  Console.log("worker scope has closed")
}
```

```output
tracked worker cleaned up
worker scope has closed
```

`make` acquires a scope-owned collection. Here `using` ties that scope to the block, whose exit interrupts remaining work and waits for cleanup. Without `using`, the collection belongs to the caller's runtime scope and `Scope` stays in the function's requirements; use that form when a service layer owns the group.
