# Producers

A producer yields values one at a time and can run Effects between yields. Use `function*` to declare one and `for...of` to consume it.

## Yield values on demand

```vibe
// run: Console.log(firstAlert())
function* readings() {
  try {
    for (const celsius of [18, 21, 25, 19, 28, 30]) {
      yield celsius
    }
  } finally {
    Console.log("sensor closed")
  }
}

function firstAlert() {
  for (const celsius of readings()) {
    if (celsius >= 25) return celsius
  }
  return undefined
}
// number | undefined!!
// Output: sensor closed
// Output: 25
```

`readings()` constructs a lazy source; its body starts when a consumer asks for a value. Each `yield` hands one value to the loop, and the producer waits until the consumer continues.

The consumer returns at 25; before `firstAlert` returns, the producer's `finally` logs `sensor closed`. `break`, a return, or a failure in the loop body closes the source and runs its cleanup. Iterating the source again starts a new run.

In `.vibe`, `function*` declares a producer; don't use it for `Effect.gen` or other generator-based APIs. Generator methods on objects remain JavaScript generators.

## Call services between yields

```vibe
// run: provide NodeServices.layer { const fs = FileSystem(); using dir = fs.makeTempDirectoryScoped(); fs.writeFileString(`${dir}/a.txt`, "short"); fs.writeFileString(`${dir}/b.txt`, "x".repeat(1001)); Console.log(firstLargeFile(dir) === `${dir}/b.txt`) }
import { NodeServices } from "@effect/platform-node"

function* fileTexts(directory: string) {
  const names = FileSystem.readDirectory(directory).sort()
  for (const name of names) {
    const path = Path.join(directory, name)
    const info = FileSystem.stat(path)
    if (info.type === "File") {
      yield { path, text: FileSystem.readFileString(path) }
    }
  }
}

function firstLargeFile(directory: string) {
  for (const file of fileTexts(directory)) {
    if (file.text.length > 1000) return file.path
  }
  return undefined
}
// Output: true
```

Service calls run as in an ordinary function, and the producer's failures and requirements join the consuming function's contract. At the application boundary, `import "vibelang/platform/node"` makes the entry supply `FileSystem` and `Path` to `main` from `NodeServices.layer`, as in `examples/file-tree`.

Resources a producer acquires with `using` stay open between yields and close when consumption finishes or stops early. This example reads one whole file at a time; stopping skips the remaining files.

## Use a producer as a Stream

```vibe
// run: Console.log(JSON.stringify(alerts()))
function alerts() {
  const selected = readings().filter((value) => value >= 25).map((value) => `${value} C`).take(2)
  const result: string[] = []
  for (const alert of selected) result.push(alert)
  return result
  // ["25 C", "28 C"]; sensor closed
}
// Output: sensor closed
// Output: ["25 C","28 C"]
```

A producer has type `Stream.Stream<Value, Error, Requirements>`: Stream operators accept it directly, and TypeScript consumers see a Stream in its declaration file. `examples/pipeline` uses this filter, map, and take pattern.

When Stream operators consume a producer, the runtime starts it on its own fiber with an unbuffered handoff: the producer yields only when the Stream pulls, and closing the Stream interrupts it and runs cleanup. Handle control operations inside the producer before passing it to Stream operators.

## Iterate any Stream

```vibe
// run: Console.log(sumStream())
function sumStream() {
  let total = 0
  for (const value of Stream.fromIterable([1, 2, 3])) {
    total += value
  }
  return total
}
// Output: 6
```

`for...of` pulls an Effect Stream and closes it when the loop exits, including on `break`. Arrays, maps, sets, and strings iterate as in JavaScript. As in JavaScript, a loop that exits early calls its iterator's `return()`, also when the body fails or the fiber is interrupted.

Use `for (const value of source)` for producers, or `for (using value of source)` when each element needs disposal at the end of its iteration. On early exit the element is disposed before the producer closes. `Array.from(source)` is not a Stream consumer; `Stream.runCollect(source)` collects all the elements into an array.

## JavaScript generators

```vibe
// run: Console.log([...countdown(3)].join(","))
function* countdown(from: number): Generator<number> {
  for (let n = from; n > 0; n--) yield n
}
// Output: 3,2,1
```

A `function*` annotated with a JavaScript iterator type, such as `Generator`, `Iterator`, `Iterable`, or their async forms, compiles to the generator TypeScript would write, for APIs that call `.next()` (D271). It is plain JavaScript, so it never fails (D296): a `throw` that can escape it is EK2003, and its `catch` receives typed failures only, so an exception a caller passes in with `generator.throw()` passes through. Remove the annotation to make it a producer, whose throws fail the Stream. Write a generator that speaks a JavaScript protocol by throwing in a `module` block or a `.ts` file.

## Coming from Effect

A generator wrapped in `Stream.unwrap` becomes a `function*`. Write calls between `yield` statements, and reserve `yield` for emitted values. Use Stream's existing operators when they express the transformation you need.
